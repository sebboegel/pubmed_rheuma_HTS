We characterized renal TLS in lupus-prone (NZBxNZW) F1 mice with respect to cell composition and vessel formation. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing was performed on transcriptomes isolated from lymph nodes (LyN), macro-dissected TLS from kidneys, and total kidneys of mice at different disease stages by using Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (Ion PGM) and RNAseq from Illumina. Formation of TLS was found in anti-dsDNA antibody positive mice and the structures were organized as interconnected large networks with distinct T/B cell zones with adjacent dendritic cells, macrophages, plasma cells, high endothelial venules, supporting follicular dendritic cells network, and functional germinal centers. Comparison of gene profiles of whole kidney, renal TLS and LyN revealed a similar gene signature of TLS and LyN. The upregulated genes within the kidneys of lupus-prone mice during the development of LN reflected the TLS formation, while the downregulated genes were involved in metabolic processes of the kidney cells. A comparison with human LN gene expression revealed similar upregulated genes as observed during the development of murine LN and TLS. We conclude that kidney TLS have a similar cell composition, structure and gene signature as LyN, and therefore may function as a kidney specific type of LyN.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020.

Moreover, elevated serum type II IFN levels precede the appearance of type I IFNs and autoantibodies in patient years before clinical diagnosis. However, the molecules and mechanisms that control this inflammatory response in SLE remain unclear. Serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) is decreased in T cells from SLE patients, and restrains T cell hyperactivity and systemic autoimmunity. Our objective here was to evaluate the role of SRSF1 in IFN-γ production, Th1 differentiation and experimental nephritis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">T cell-conditional Srsf1-knockout mice were used to study nephrotoxic serum-induced nephritis and evaluate IFN-γ production and Th1 differentiation by flow cytometry. RNA sequencing was used to assess transcriptomics profiles. RhoH was silenced by siRNA transfections in human T cells by electroporation. RhoH and SRSF1 protein levels were assessed by immunoblots.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Deletion of Srsf1 in T cells led to increased Th1 differentiation and exacerbated nephrotoxic serum nephritis. The expression levels of RhoH are decreased in Srsf1-deficient T cells, and silencing RhoH in human T cells leads to increased production of IFN-γ. Furthermore, RhoH expression was decreased and directly correlated with SRSF1 in T cells from SLE patients.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study uncovers a previously unrecognized role of SRSF1 in restraining IFN-γ production and Th1 differentiation through the control of RhoH. Reduced expression of SRSF1 may contribute to pathogenesis of autoimmune-related nephritis through these molecular mechanisms.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2020.

However, little research has been conducted on the effect of ageing on the expression of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs). RNA from young and old chondrocytes from macroscopically normal equine metacarpophalangeal joints was extracted and subjected to small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Differential expression analysis was performed in R using package DESeq2. For transfer RNA (tRNA) fragment analysis, tRNA reads were aligned to horse tRNA sequences using Bowtie2 version 2.2.5. Selected microRNA (miRNAs or miRs) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) findings were validated using real-time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) in an extended cohort of equine chondrocytes. tRNA fragments were further investigated in low- and high-grade OA human cartilage tissue. In total, 83 sncRNAs were differentially expressed between young and old equine chondrocytes, including miRNAs, snoRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and tRNAs. qRT-PCR analysis confirmed findings. tRNA fragment analysis revealed that tRNA halves (tiRNAs), tiRNA-5035-GluCTC and tiRNA-5031-GluCTC-1 were reduced in both high grade OA human cartilage and old equine chondrocytes. For the first time, we have measured the effect of ageing on the expression of sncRNAs in equine chondrocytes. Changes were detected in a number of different sncRNA species. This study supports a role for sncRNAs in ageing cartilage and their potential involvement in age-related cartilage diseases.</AbstractText> "
"5";"32778763";"Trans-ancestral dissection of urate- and gout-associated major loci SLC2A9 and ABCG2 reveals primate-specific regulatory effects.";" <AbstractText>Gout is a complex inflammatory arthritis affecting ~20% of people with an elevated serum urate level (hyperuricemia). Gout and hyperuricemia are essentially specific to humans and other higher primates, with varied prevalence across ancestral groups. SLC2A9 and ABCG2 are major loci associated with both urate and gout in multiple ancestral groups. However, fine mapping has been challenging due to extensive linkage disequilibrium underlying the associated regions. We used trans-ancestral fine mapping integrated with primate-specific genomic information to address this challenge. Trans-ancestral meta-analyses of GWAS cohorts of either European (EUR) or East Asian (EAS) ancestry resulted in single-variant resolution mappings for SLC2A9 (rs3775948 for urate and rs4697701 for gout) and ABCG2 (rs2622621 for gout). Tests of colocalization of variants in both urate and gout suggested existence of a shared candidate causal variant for SLC2A9 only in EUR and for ABCG2 only in EAS. The fine-mapped gout variant rs4697701 was within an ancient enhancer, whereas rs2622621 was within a primate-specific transposable element, both supported by functional evidence from the Roadmap Epigenomics project in human primary tissues relevant to urate and gout. Additional primate-specific elements were found near both loci and those adjacent to SLC2A9 overlapped with known statistical epistatic interactions associated with urate as well as multiple super-enhancers identified in urate-relevant tissues. We conclude that by leveraging ancestral differences trans-ancestral fine mapping has identified ancestral and functional variants for SLC2A9 or ABCG2 with primate-specific regulatory effects on urate and gout.</AbstractText> "

Here, we report the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) to establish a diagnosis in a family in which individuals were affected with gout, hyperuricemia associated with reduced fractional excretion of uric acid, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and secondary hyperparathyroidism, that are consistent with familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN). However, single gene testing had not detected mutations in the uromodulin (UMOD) or renin (REN) genes, which cause approximately 30-90% of FJHN. WGS was therefore undertaken, and this identified a heterozygous c.226G&gt;C (p.Gly76Arg) missense variant in the paired box gene 2 (PAX2) gene, which co-segregated with renal tubulopathy in the family. PAX2 mutations are associated with renal coloboma syndrome (RCS), which is characterized by abnormalities in renal structure and function, and anomalies of the optic nerve. Ophthalmological examination in two adult brothers affected with hyperuricemia, gout, and CKD revealed the presence of optic disc pits, consistent with optic nerve coloboma, thereby revising the diagnosis from FJHN to RCS. Thus, our results demonstrate the utility of WGS analysis in establishing the correct diagnosis in disorders with multiple etiologies.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 The Authors.

"7";"32775469";"Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Profile of Meniscal Tissue Macrophages in Human Osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) has long been considered as a degenerative disease, but growing evidence suggests that inflammation plays a vital role in its pathogenesis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, inflammation in OA is chronic and, in relatively low grade, mainly mediated by the innate immune system, especially macrophages. However, due to its low abundance, there is a lack of systematic studies on macrophages in the OA condition. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to gain insight into the heterogeneity and functional specialization of human knee macrophages. We also compared the gene expression profiles of macrophages in healthy people and OA patients and found the characteristic changes of special macrophages in the OA knee. We believe that this in-depth understanding of the basis of OA inflammation will bring hope for the development of new therapies.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Jingbin Zhou et al.</CopyrightInformation> "
"8";"32767602";"The miRNA-mRNA interactome of murine induced pluripotent stem cell-derived chondrocytes in response to inflammatory cytokines.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease, and inflammation within an arthritic joint plays a critical role in disease progression. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically IL-1 and TNF-α, induce aberrant expression of catabolic and degradative enzymes and inflammatory cytokines in OA and result in a challenging environment for cartilage repair and regeneration. MicroRNAs (miRNAS) are small noncoding RNAs and are important regulatory molecules that act by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to reduce protein synthesis and have been implicated in many diseases, including OA. The goal of this study was to understand the mechanisms of miRNA regulation of the transcriptome of tissue-engineered cartilage in response to IL-1β and TNF-α using an in vitro murine induced pluripotent stem cell (miPSC) model system. We performed miRNA and mRNA sequencing to determine the temporal and dynamic responses of genes to specific inflammatory cytokines as well as miRNAs that are differentially expressed (DE) in response to both cytokines or exclusively to IL-1β or TNF-α. Through integration of mRNA and miRNA sequencing data, we created networks of miRNA-mRNA interactions which may be controlling the response to inflammatory cytokines. Within the networks, hub miRNAs, miR-29b-3p, miR-17-5p, and miR-20a-5p, were identified. As validation of these findings, we found that delivery of miR-17-5p and miR-20a-5p mimics significantly decreased degradative enzyme activity levels while also decreasing expression of inflammation-related genes in cytokine-treated cells. This study utilized an integrative approach to determine the miRNA interactome controlling the response to inflammatory cytokines and novel mediators of inflammation-driven degradation in tissue-engineered cartilage.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"9";"32750333";"Complex Autoinflammatory Syndrome Unveils Fundamental Principles of JAK1 Kinase Transcriptional and Biochemical Function.";" <AbstractText>Autoinflammatory disease can result from monogenic errors of immunity. We describe a patient with early-onset multi-organ immune dysregulation resulting from a mosaic, gain-of-function mutation (S703I) in JAK1, encoding a kinase essential for signaling downstream of &gt;25 cytokines. By custom single-cell RNA sequencing, we examine mosaicism with single-cell resolution. We find that JAK1 transcription was predominantly restricted to a single allele across different cells, introducing the concept of a mutational &quot;transcriptotype&quot; that differs from the genotype. Functionally, the mutation increases JAK1 activity and transactivates partnering JAKs, independent of its catalytic domain. S703I JAK1 is not only hypermorphic for cytokine signaling but also neomorphic, as it enables signaling cascades not canonically mediated by JAK1. Given these results, the patient was treated with tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor, leading to the rapid resolution of clinical disease. These findings offer a platform for personalized medicine with the concurrent discovery of fundamental biological principles.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we profiled ~276,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 33 children with SLE with different degrees of disease activity and 11 matched controls. Increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) distinguished cells from children with SLE from healthy control cells. The high ISG expression signature (ISG<sup>hi</sup>) derived from a small number of transcriptionally defined subpopulations within major cell types, including monocytes, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, natural killer cells, conventional and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, B cells and especially plasma cells. Expansion of unique subpopulations enriched in ISGs and/or in monogenic lupus-associated genes classified patients with the highest disease activity. Profiling of ~82,000 single peripheral blood mononuclear cells from adults with SLE confirmed the expansion of similar subpopulations in patients with the highest disease activity. This study lays the groundwork for resolving the origin of the SLE transcriptional signatures and the disease heterogeneity towards precision medicine applications.</AbstractText> "

Clinical phenotypes are heterogenous and resemble Behçet's disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or periodic fever syndrome, with symptoms developing at an early age. Here, we report the first case of infantile familial HA20 in Korea, which mimics neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). A 2-month-old infant exhibited symptoms including recurrent fever, erythematous rashes, and oral ulcers, with elevated liver enzymes, and tested positive for several autoantibodies, similar to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); therefore, she was suspected to have NLE. However, six months after birth, symptoms and autoantibodies persisted. Then, we considered the possibility of other diseases that could cause early onset rashes and abnormal autoantibodies, including autoinflammatory syndrome, monogenic SLE, or complement deficiency, all of which are rare. The detailed family history revealed that her father had recurrent symptoms, including oral and genital ulcers, knee arthralgia, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. These Behcet-like symptoms last for many years since he was a teenager, and he takes medications irregularly only when those are severe, but doesn't want the full-scale treatment. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted to identify a possible genetic disorder, which manifested as pathogenic variant nonsense mutation in the <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene, leading to HA20. In conclusion, HA20 should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an infant with an early-onset dominantly inherited inflammatory disease that presents with recurrent oral and genital ulcerations and fluctuating autoantibodies. Additionally, it also should be considered in an infant with suspected NLE, whose symptoms and abnormal autoantibodies persist.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.</CopyrightInformation> "

We found de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to be significantly enriched in gene promoters in SLE patients compared with healthy controls at a level corresponding to 26 de novo promoter SNVs more in each patient than expected. We identified 12 de novo SNVs in promoter regions of genes that have been previously implicated in SLE, or that have functions that could be of relevance to SLE. Furthermore, we detected three missense de novo SNVs, five de novo insertion-deletions, and three de novo structural variants with potential to affect the expression of genes that are relevant for SLE. Based on enrichment analysis, disease-affecting de novo SNVs are expected to occur in one-third of SLE patients. This study shows that de novo variants in promoters commonly contribute to the genetic risk of SLE. The fact that de novo SNVs in SLE were enriched to promoter regions highlights the importance of using whole-genome sequencing for identification of de novo variants.</AbstractText> "

Haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20) is a recently described autoinflammatory disease with a phenotype resembling BD, caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene (encoding A20). <b>Methods:</b> We described a 29-year-old female with iBD-like symptoms including relapsing ulceration of intestinal anastomosis, recurrent oral ulcers and vasculitis in extremities. Due to the atypical intestinal ulcers with long segmental involvement and intestinal obstruction, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed to screen for the underlying genetic defect and the identified gene was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The expression levels of A20 was evaluated by Western blot. Sanger sequencing and Western blot were also performed in the patient's family members. <b>Results:</b> A heterozygous mutation of <i>TNFAIP3</i> (c.305A&gt;G, p.

Functional experiments revealed that the expression of A20 was decreased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patient and her family members who carried the TNFAIP3 mutation. <b>Conclusion:</b> We described a Chinese patient with a novel heterozygous mutation in <i>TNFAIP3</i> who developed iBD-like symptoms. We proposed that the <i>TNFAIP3</i> heterozygous mutation (c.305A&gt;G, p.

The experimental rats were divided into the normal group (N), model group (M), moxibustion treatment group (MS), and diclofenac sodium treatment group (DS). After 4 weeks, cartilage pathological damage in the knee joint was evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin and safranin O-fast green staining analysis. ELISAs and Western blots were used to detect the expression levels of IL-1<i>β</i> and TNF-<i>α</i> in the serum and cartilage, respectively. The total DNA of the fecal samples was extracted and subjected to high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to analyze the changes in the intestinal flora. In the model group, the cartilage was obviously damaged, the expression levels of IL-1<i>β</i> and TNF-<i>α</i> in the serum and cartilage were increased, and the abundance and diversity of the intestinal flora were decreased. Moxibustion treatment significantly improved the cartilage damage and reduced the concentration of inflammatory factors in the serum and cartilage. The high-throughput sequencing results showed that compared to the model group, the moxibustion treatment regulated some specific species in the intestinal microorganisms rather than the <i>α</i> diversity. In conclusion, our findings suggest that moxibustion treatment may work through two aspects in rats. On one hand, it directly acts on knee cartilage to promote repair, and on the other hand, it regulates the composition of the intestinal flora and reduces the production of inflammatory factors.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Yu Chen et al.</CopyrightInformation> "
"23";"32714114";"A Pharmacological Interactome between COVID-19 Patient Samples and Human Sensory Neurons Reveals Potential Drivers of Neurogenic Pulmonary Dysfunction.";" <AbstractText>The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects cells of the airway and lungs in humans causing the disease COVID-19. This disease is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can be fatal. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in pathology and mortality. We sought to quantify how immune cells might interact with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 using published data from patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human dorsal root ganglion neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide ligand-receptor pair database curated for pharmacological interactions relevant for neuro-immune interactions. Our findings reveal a landscape of ligand-receptor interactions in the lung caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and point to potential interventions to reduce the burden of neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19 disease. In particular, our work highlights opportunities for clinical trials with existing or under-development rheumatoid arthritis and other (e.g. CCL2, CCR5 or EGFR inhibitors) drugs to treat high risk or severe COVID-19 cases.</AbstractText> "

Feces and serum of the subjects were sampled in sterile environment. Serum samples were examined for anti dsDNA antibodies. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing, using Illumina MiSeq 2 × 250 sequencing platform. The results suggested that positive rate of anti-dsDNA antibody in serum was significantly higher in the experimental group than the control group. Significant difference of intestinal microbiome was spotted between the two groups in phylum (<i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Bacteroidetes</i>) and genus level (<i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Allobaculum</i>, <i>Lachnospira</i>, <i>Turicibacter</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>). The different intestinal microbiomes existing in healthy people and patients can provide a strong tool for accurate diagnose of lupus erythematosus.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 The Authors.</CopyrightInformation> "

By 8 weeks all genes had returned to baseline levels and no evidence of fibrosis or chronic inflammation was observed from histology. When gel injection was combined with SSP tendon repair, we observed a significant reduction (7%) in SSP muscle atrophy (24 + 3% reduction from uninjured) when compared with treatment with tendon repair only (31 + 7% reduction). Although fatty degeneration was elevated in both treatment groups, fat content trended lower (2%) in response to combined tendon repair and intramuscular ECM injection (4.1 + 2.1%) when compared with tendon repair only (6.1 + 2.9%). Transcriptome analysis revealed adipogenesis and osteoarthritis pathway activation in the repair only group. These key pathways were abrogated in response to treatment using combined repair plus gel.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The findings suggest that ECM injection had a modest but positive effect on muscle mass, fatty degeneration, and key cellular signaling pathways.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.

We previously predicted antivirals (atazanavir, remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir) and non-antiviral drugs (tiotropium and rapamycin) that may inhibit the replication complex of SARS-CoV-2 using our molecular transformer-drug target interaction (MT-DTI) deep-learning-based drug-target affinity prediction model. In this study, we dissected molecular pathways upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells by analyzing an RNA-seq data set with various bioinformatics approaches, such as gene ontology, protein-protein interaction-based network and gene set enrichment analyses. The results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 infection strongly activates TNF and NFκB-signaling pathways through significant upregulation of the <i>TNF</i>, <i>IL1B</i>, <i>IL6</i>, <i>IL8</i>, <i>NFKB1</i>, <i>NFKB2</i> and <i>RELB</i> genes. In addition to these pathways, lung fibrosis, keratinization/cornification, rheumatoid arthritis, and negative regulation of interferon-gamma production pathways were also significantly upregulated. We observed that these pathologic features of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to those observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Intriguingly, tiotropium, as predicted by MT-DTI, is currently used as a therapeutic intervention in COPD patients. Treatment with tiotropium has been shown to improve pulmonary function by alleviating airway inflammation. Accordingly, a literature search summarized that tiotropium reduced expressions of <i>IL1B</i>, <i>IL6</i>, <i>IL8</i>, <i>RELA, NFKB1</i> and TNF in vitro or in vivo, and many of them have been known to be deregulated in COPD patients. These results suggest that COVID-19 is similar to an acute mode of COPD caused by the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and therefore tiotropium may be effective for COVID-19 patients.</AbstractText> "

The molecular events leading to flares are unknown.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We established a clinical and technical protocol for repeated home collection of blood in patients with rheumatoid arthritis to allow for longitudinal RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Specimens were obtained from 364 time points during eight flares over a period of 4 years in our index patient, as well as from 235 time points during flares in three additional patients. We identified transcripts that were differentially expressed before flares and compared these with data from synovial single-cell RNA-seq. Flow cytometry and sorted-blood-cell RNA-seq in additional patients were used to validate the findings.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Consistent changes were observed in blood transcriptional profiles 1 to 2 weeks before a rheumatoid arthritis flare. B-cell activation was followed by expansion of circulating CD45-CD31-PDPN+ preinflammatory mesenchymal, or PRIME, cells in the blood from patients with rheumatoid arthritis; these cells shared features of inflammatory synovial fibroblasts. Levels of circulating PRIME cells decreased during flares in all 4 patients, and flow cytometry and sorted-cell RNA-seq confirmed the presence of PRIME cells in 19 additional patients with rheumatoid arthritis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Longitudinal genomic analysis of rheumatoid arthritis flares revealed PRIME cells in the blood during the period before a flare and suggested a model in which these cells become activated by B cells in the weeks before a flare and subsequently migrate out of the blood into the synovium.

Deletion of the entire miR-140 locus in mice results in growth retardation and early-onset osteoarthritis-like pathology, however the relative contribution of miR-140-5p or miR-140-3p to the phenotype remains to be determined. An unbiased small RNA sequencing approach identified miR-140-3p as significantly more abundant (&gt;10-fold) than miR-140-5p in human cartilage. Analysis of these data identified multiple miR-140-3p isomiRs differing from the miRBase annotation at both the 5´ and 3´ end, with &gt;99% having one of two seed sequences (5´ bases 2-8). Canonical (miR-140-3p.2) and shifted (miR-140-3p.1) seed isomiRs were overexpressed in chondrocytes and transcriptomics performed to identify targets. miR-140-3p.1 and miR-140-3p.2 significantly downregulated 694 and 238 genes respectively, of which only 162 genes were commonly downregulated. IsomiR targets were validated using 3 ´UTR luciferase assays. miR-140-3p.1 targets were enriched within upregulated genes in rib chondrocytes of Mir140-null mice and within downregulated genes during human chondrogenesis. Finally, through imputing the expression of miR-140 from the expression of the host gene WWP2 in 124 previously published datasets, an inverse correlation with miR-140-3p.1 predicted targets was identified. Together these data suggest the novel seed containing isomiR miR-140-3p.1 is more functional than original consensus miR-140-3p seed containing isomiR.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press for the RNA Society.</CopyrightInformation> "

Serum C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) levels were low, and clinical exome next-generation sequencing detected a frameshift mutation in the <i>SERPING-1</i> gene in all three patients. The mother had neither of the clinical phenotypes. The son had cutaneous symptoms, fever and polyarthralgia, along with lupus nephritis, and thus required rituximab therapy as well as mycophenolate mofetil and low-dose steroids to control disease activity. The daughter had a milder disease, with cutaneous manifestation, fever and polyarthralgia, and which was controlled with mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine and low-dose steroids. Both children had never experienced angioedema. The father had a long history of self-limiting, non-life-threatening irregular episodes of subcutaneous angioedema and abdomen pain. He was not on any regular medication for these symptoms. We searched the literature for evidence of hereditary C1-INH deficiency associated with monogenic SLE or SLE-like-phenotype.</AbstractText> "

"33";"32650430";"Distal-Less Homeobox 5 Is a Therapeutic Target for Attenuating Hypertrophy and Apoptosis of Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells.";" <AbstractText>Chondrocyte hypertrophy is a hallmark of osteoarthritis (OA) pathology. In the present study, we elucidated the mechanism underlying the relationship between the hypertrophy/apoptotic phenotype and OA pathogenesis in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) via gene targeting of distal-less homeobox 5 (DLX5). Our primary objectives were (1) to determine whether DLX5 is a predictive biomarker of cellular hypertrophy in human osteoarthritic tissues; (2) To determine whether modulating DLX5 activity can regulate cell hypertrophy in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells from marrow and cartilage. Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed to identify differences in the RNA expression profile between human-cartilage-derived mesenchymal progenitors (C-PCs) and bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (BM-MSCs). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was used to compare molecular pathways known to regulate hypertrophic terminal cell differentiation. RT-qPCR was used to measure DLX5 and hypertrophy marker COL10 in healthy human chondrocytes and OA chondrocytes. DLX5 was knocked down or overexpressed in BM-MSCs and C-PCs and RT-qPCR were used to measure the expression of hypertrophy/terminal differentiation markers following DLX5 modulation. Apoptotic cell activity was characterized by immunostaining for cleaved caspase 3/7. We demonstrate that DLX5 and downstream hypertrophy markers were significantly upregulated in BM-MSCs, relative to C-PCs. DLX5 and COL10 were also significantly upregulated in cells from OA knee joint tissues, relative to normal non-arthritic joint tissues. Knocking down DLX5 in BM-MSCs inhibited cell hypertrophy and apoptotic activity without attenuating their chondrogenic potential. Overexpression of DLX5 in C-PCs stimulated hypertrophy markers and increased apoptotic cell activity. Modulating DLX5 activity regulates cell hypertrophy and apoptosis in BM-MSCs and C-PCs. These findings suggest that DLX5 is a biomarker of OA changes in human knee joint tissues and confirms the DLX5 mechanism contributes to hypertrophy and apoptosis in BM-MSCs.</AbstractText> "

Flufenamic acid is a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug approved for clinical use to relieve inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In this study, we explored the antibacterial efficacy of flufenamic acid and the mechanisms underlying this effect. By using minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), time-kill, resistance induction assays, and the antibiotic synergy test, we demonstrated that flufenamic acid inhibited the growth of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and did not induce resistance when it was used at the MIC. Furthermore, flufenamic acid acted synergistically with the beta-lactam antibiotic oxacillin and did not show significant toxicity toward mammalian cells. The biofilm inhibition assay revealed that flufenamic acid could prevent biofilm formation on medical implants and destroy the ultrastructure of the bacterial cell wall. RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR indicated that flufenamic acid inhibited the expression of genes associated with peptidoglycan biosynthesis, beta-lactam resistance, quorum sensing, and biofilm formation. Furthermore, flufenamic acid efficiently ameliorated a local infection caused by MRSA in mice. In conclusion, flufenamic acid may be a potent therapeutic compound against MRSA infections and a promising candidate for antimicrobial coating of implants and surgical devices.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Histologically, DM lesions appear similar to cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) lesions and frequently cannot be differentiated. We thus compared the transcriptional profile of DM biopsies with CLE lesions to identify unique features. Type I IFN signaling, including IFN-κ upregulation, was a common pathway in both DM and CLE; however, CLE also exhibited other inflammatory pathways. Notably, DM lesions could be distinguished from CLE by a 5-gene biomarker panel that included IL18 upregulation. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we further identified keratinocytes as the main source of increased IL-18 in DM skin. This study identifies a potentially novel molecular signature, with significant clinical implications for differentiating DM from CLE lesions, and highlights the potential role for IL-18 in the pathophysiology of DM skin disease.</AbstractText> "

When the disease progressed again, the patient received an off-label treatment with pembrolizumab (100 mg every 3 weeks). After four cycles of immunotherapy treatment, CA19-9 level rapidly decreased to normal and the lymph node metastases reduced dramatically in volume, demonstrating a partial response to the therapy by RECIST 1.1 criteria. She continued on pembrolizumab and a total of eight cycles of administration she had received. Her lesions showed consistent reduction in size even when the medication had been stopped.

Relatively little is known regarding the pathogenesis of gouty inflammation. To investigate the epigenetic background of gouty inflammation independent of hyperuricemia and its relationship to genetics, 69 gout patients and 1455 non-gout controls were included. Promoter-wide methylation was profiled with EPIC array. Whole-genome sequencing data were included for genetic and methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) analyses and causal inference tests. Identified loci were subjected to co-methylation analysis and functional localization with DNase hypersensitivity and histone marks analysis. An expression database was queried to clarify biologic functions of identified loci. A transcription factor dataset was integrated to identify transcription factors coordinating respective expression. In total, seven CpG loci involved in interleukin-1β production survived genetic/meQTL analyses, or causal inference tests. None had a significant relationship with various metabolic traits. Additional analysis suggested gouty inflammation, instead of hyperuricemia, provides the link between these CpG sites and gout. Six (<i>PGGT1B</i>, <i>INSIG1</i>, <i>ANGPTL2</i>, <i>JNK1</i>, <i>UBAP1</i>, and <i>RAPTOR</i>) were novel genes in the field of gout. One (<i>CNTN5</i>) was previously associated with gouty inflammation. Transcription factor mapping identified several potential transcription factors implicated in the link between differential methylation, interleukin-1β production, and gouty inflammation. In conclusion, this study revealed several novel genes specific to gouty inflammation and provided enhanced insight into the biological basis of gouty inflammation.</AbstractText> "

However, the molecular basis for sex disparity in SLE remains poorly understood. To examine the role of X-linked transcription in SLE adaptive immune cells, we performed RNA-seq in T-cell and B-cell subsets from either healthy donors or patients with SLE. Analyses of allelic expression (AE) profiles identified a pattern of increased allelic imbalance across the entire X-chromosome in SLE lymphocytes. X-linked genes exhibiting AE in SLE had an extensive overlap with genes known to escape X-chromosome inactivation (XCI). XIST RNA was over-expressed in SLE patients. Differential XIST expression correlated with AE profiles more positively at X-linked genes than the genome-wide background. Analysis of three independent RNA-seq data verified the XIST-associated skewed AE on X-chromosome in SLE. Integrative analyses of DNA methylation profiles showed an increased variability of DNA methylation levels at these AE-related X-linked genes. In cultured lymphoblastic cells, knockdown of XIST specifically altered allelic imbalance patterns between X chromosomes. Our study provides genetic evidence that up-regulation of XIST accompanied with more skewed allelic expression on X-chromosome is associated with the pathogenesis of SLE and may provide mechanistic insights into the increased incidence of SLE in females.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2020.

Multiple cell types were identified based on profiling of 10,640 synoviocytes and 26,192 chondrocytes: 12 distinct synovial cell types and 7 distinct articular chondrocyte phenotypes from matched tissues. Intact cartilage was enriched for homeostatic and hypertrophic chondrocytes, while damaged cartilage was enriched for prefibro- and fibro-, regulatory, reparative and prehypertrophic chondrocytes. A total of 61 cytokines and growth factors were predicted to regulate the 7 chondrocyte cell phenotypes. Based on production by &gt; 1% of cells, 55% of the cytokines were produced by synovial cells (39% exclusive to synoviocytes and not expressed by chondrocytes) and their presence in osteoarthritic synovial fluid confirmed. The synoviocytes producing IL-1beta (a classic pathogenic cytokine in osteoarthritis), mainly inflammatory macrophages and dendritic cells, were characterized by co-expression of surface proteins corresponding to HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQA2, OLR1 or TLR2. Strategies to deplete these pathogenic intra-articular cell subpopulations could be a therapeutic option for human osteoarthritis.</AbstractText> "

Metabolic abnormalities cause dysregulation of multiple immune cells, but the metabolic regulation of IFN-I production is far from clarified in SLE.

The effects of SLE-related metabolites on IFN-I production were explored on human and mouse pDCs. The ROS levels of pDCs from wild type and NCF1<sup>-/-</sup> mice were measured by flow cytometry. Mechanisms were investigated by RNA sequencing and immunoblots. In vivo effects of SLE-relevant metabolite were systemically analyzed on B6.Cg-Sle1<sup>NZM2410/Aeg</sup> Yaa/DcrJ mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Taurine was higher in SLE patients' serum compared with healthy controls (P &lt; 0.001) and RA patients (P &lt; 0.001).

Gene expression profiles of different groups identified 49 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were mainly enriched in the structural constituents of the ribosome, the extracellular space, and inflammatory response. The NF-κB pathway was highly enriched, and the expression levels of DEGs associated with it (<i>Nfkbia, Ptgs2, Rela, Tnfrsf1a, Tradd, Traf2</i>) under TNF-α stimulation were reversed by MGL. Further studies proved that MGL simultaneously suppressed the cell nucleus translocation of p65 and the phosphorylation of IκBα.

Sporadic (also known as early-onset sarcoidosis) or familial BS is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the <i>NOD2</i> gene, which encodes for a multi-task protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune defense. We report on three Mexican patients clinically diagnosed with BS who exhibited a likely pathogenic variant in <i>NOD2</i> as revealed by whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing: two variants (c.1000 C &gt; T/p.Arg334Trp and c.1538 T &gt; C/p.Met513Thr) lie in the ATP/Mg2+ binding site, whereas the other (c.3019dupC/p.Leu1007ProfsTer2) introduces a premature stop codon disrupting the last LRR domain (LRR9) formation; all three variants are consistent with gain-of-function changes. Interestingly, all these patients presented concomitant likely pathogenic variants in other inflammatory disease-related genes, i.e. <i>TLR10</i>, <i>PRR12</i>, <i>MEFV</i> and/or <i>SLC22A5</i>. Although the clinical presentation in these patients included the BS diagnostic triad, overall it was rather heterogeneous. It is plausible that this clinical variability depends partly on the patients' genetic background as suggested by our WES results. After this molecular diagnosis and given the absence of <i>NOD2</i> mutations (demonstrated in two trios) and related symptoms in the respective parents (confirmed in all trios), patients 1 and 2 were considered to have sporadic BS, while patient 3, a sporadic BS-recurrent polyserositis compound phenotype. Altogether, our observations and findings underscore the overlapping among inflammatory diseases and the importance of determining the underlying genetic cause by high-throughput methods. Likewise, this study further reinforces a pathogenic link between the here found <i>NOD2</i> variants and BS and envisages potential additive effects from other loci in these, and probably other patients.</AbstractText> "

In this study, we aimed to explore the dysregulated expression of 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from patients with SLE and the potential function of affected mRNAs in SLE pathogenesis. mRNA methylation profiles were ascertained through chromatography-coupled triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from two pools of patients with SLE exhibiting stable activity, two pools with moderate-to-major activity, and two pools of healthy controls (HCs). Simultaneously, mRNA methylation profiles and expression profiling were performed using RNA-Bis-Seq and RNA-Seq, respectively. Integrated mRNA methylation and mRNA expression bioinformatics analysis was comprehensively performed. mRNA methyltransferase NSUN2 expression was validated in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from 27 patients with SLE and 28 HCs using real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. Hypomethylated-mRNA profiles of NSUN2-knockdown HeLa cells and of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of patients with SLE were jointly analyzed using bioinformatics. Eleven methylation modifications (including elevated Am, 3'OMeA, m<sup>1</sup>A, and m<sup>6</sup>A and decreased Ψ, m<sup>3</sup>C, m<sup>1</sup>G, m<sup>5</sup>U, and t<sup>6</sup>A levels) were detected in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of patients with SLE. Additionally, decreased m<sup>5</sup>C levels, albeit increased number of m<sup>5</sup>C-containing mRNAs, were observed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of patients with SLE compared with that in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of HCs. m<sup>5</sup>C site distribution in mRNA transcripts was highly conserved and enriched in mRNA translation initiation sites. In particular, hypermethylated m<sup>5</sup>C or/and significantly up-regulated genes in SLE were significantly involved in immune-related and inflammatory pathways, including immune system, cytokine signaling pathway, and interferon signaling. Compared to that in HCs, NSUN2 expression was significantly lower in SLE CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Notably, hypomethylated m<sup>5</sup>C genes in SLE and in NSUN2-knockdown HeLa cells revealed linkage between eukaryotic translation elongation and termination, and mRNA metabolism. Our study identified novel aberrant m<sup>5</sup>C mRNAs relevant to critical immune pathways in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from patients with SLE. These data provide valuable perspectives for future studies of the multifunctionality and post-transcriptional significance of mRNA m<sup>5</sup>C modification in SLE.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Guo, Wang, Shi, Ye, Yan, Chen, Zhang, Jin and Xue.</CopyrightInformation> "

Human lncRNAs have well-characterized roles in gene expression regulation, particularly with regard to protein-coding genes, and their dysregulation has been linked to disease. Here, we set out to investigate changes in the expression of lncRNAs related to apoptosis and autophagy in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, we aimed to correlate lncRNA expression profiles with clinical indexes and self-perception of patients (SPP). To this end, we employed RNA sequencing of lncRNAs in PBMCs from three patients with RA and three healthy controls. We used bioinformatics to screen several dysregulated lncRNAs related to apoptosis and autophagy. To validate key lncRNA candidates, we performed quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR on 20 patients with RA and 20 healthy controls. We found the expression of seven lncRNAs (MAPKAPK5-AS1, ENST00000619282, C5orf17, LINC01189, LINC01006, DSCR9 and MIR22HG) was significantly altered in PBMCs of patients with RA. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that MIR22HG [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.846, P = 0.000], DSCR9 (AUC = 0.783, P = 0.005), LINC01189 (AUC = 0.677, P = 0.034), MAPKAPK5-AS1 (AUC = 0.644, P = 0.025) and ENST00000619282 (AUC = 0.636, P = 0.043) are potential biomarkers of RA. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed selected lncRNAs correlated with clinical indexes and SPP. Therefore, we highlight that some lncRNAs related to apoptosis and autophagy may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and monitoring of RA progression, which also correlate with several clinical indexes and SPP.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 The Authors.

"55";"32564401";"LPS-Induced Inflammation Prior to Injury Exacerbates the Development of Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis in Mice.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating and painful disease characterized by the progressive loss of articular cartilage. Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is an injury-induced type of OA that persists in an asymptomatic phase for years before it becomes diagnosed in ~50% of injured individuals. Although PTOA is not classified as an inflammatory disease, it has been suggested that inflammation could be a major driver of PTOA development. Here we examined whether a state of systemic inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration 5-days before injury would modulate PTOA outcomes. RNA-seq analysis at 1-day post-injury followed by micro-computed tomography (μCT) and histology characterization at 6 weeks post-injury revealed that LPS administration causes more severe PTOA phenotypes. These phenotypes included significantly higher loss of cartilage and subchondral bone volume. Gene expression analysis showed that LPS alone induced a large cohort of inflammatory genes previously shown to be elevated in synovial M1 macrophages of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, suggesting that systemic LPS produces synovitis. This synovitis was sufficient to promote PTOA in MRL/MpJ mice, a strain previously shown to be resistant to PTOA. The synovium of LPS-treated injured joints displayed an increase in cellularity, and immunohistological examination confirmed that this increase was in part attributable to an elevation in type 1 macrophages. LPS induced the expression of Tlr7 and Tlr8 in both injured and uninjured joints, genes known to be elevated in RA. We conclude that inflammation before injury is an important risk factor for the development of PTOA and that correlating patient serum endotoxin levels or their state of systemic inflammation with PTOA progression may help develop new, effective treatments to lower the rate of PTOA in injured individuals. © 2020 The Authors.

The RNA from circulatory CD14+ monocytes was isolated from PsA patients, psoriasis patients without arthritis (PsO), and healthy controls (HCs). The miRNAs were initially profiled by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The candidate miRNAs revealed by NGS were validated by PCR in 40 PsA patients, 40 PsO patients, and 40 HCs. The osteoclast differentiation and its functional resorption activity were measured with or without RNA interference against the candidate miRNA. The microRNA-941 was selectively upregulated in CD14+ monocytes from PsA patients. Osteoclast development and resorption ability were increased in CD14+ monocytes from PsA patients. Inhibition of miR-941 abrogated the osteoclast development and function while increased the expression of WNT16. After successful treatment, the increased miR-941 expression in CD14+ monocytes from PsA patients was revoked. The expression of miR-941 in CD14+ monocytes is associated with PsA disease activity. MiR-941 enhances osteoclastogenesis in PsA via WNT16 repression. The miR-941 could be a potential biomarker and treatment target for PsA.</AbstractText> "

"60";"32557565";"Rheumatoid arthritis synovial microenvironment induces metabolic and functional adaptations in dendritic cells.";" <AbstractText>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease which causes degradation of cartilage and bone. It is well appreciated that the pathogenic hallmark of RA is the mass influx of inflammatory cells into the joint. However, the role that dendritic cells (DC) may play in this inflammatory milieu is still relatively unexplored. Moreover, the contribution this unique synovial microenvironment has on DC maturation is still unknown. Using monocyte-derived DC (MoDC), we established an in-vitro model to recapitulate the synovial microenvironment to explore DC maturation. MoDC treated with conditioned media from ex-vivo synovial tissue biopsy cultures [explant-conditioned media (ECM)] have increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules. ECM DC have increased expression of CD83 and CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)7 and decreased expression of CCR5 and phagocytic capacity, suggestive of heightened DC maturation. ECM-induced maturation is concomitant with altered cellular bioenergetics, whereby increased expression of glycolytic genes and increased glucose uptake are observed in ECM DC. Collectively, this results in a metabolic shift in DC metabolism in favour of glycolysis. These adaptations are in-part mediated via signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3), as demonstrated by decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and glycolytic genes in ECM DC in response to STAT-3 inhibition. Finally, to translate these data to a more in-vivo clinically relevant setting, RNA-seq was performed on RA synovial fluid and peripheral blood. We identified enhanced expression of a number of glycolytic genes in synovial CD1c<sup>+</sup> DC compared to CD1c<sup>+</sup> DC in circulation. Collectively, our data suggest that the synovial microenvironment in RA contributes to DC maturation and metabolic reprogramming.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 British Society for Immunology.</CopyrightInformation> "

In vitro peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) stimulations for cytokine expression and caspase-1 activity assays as well as NF-κB reporter luciferase assays were performed to functionally characterize variants.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">WES revealed an extremely rare heterozygous missense variant, c.482G&gt;A, p.R161H in the CASP1 gene encoding pro-caspase-1. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of patient PBMCs induced high levels of IL-6 compared to controls, and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome resulted in increased production of IL-1β and IL-18 as well as significantly elevated caspase-1 activity. Constitutive and inducible levels of IL-18 and IFNγ in whole blood were markedly elevated. Expression of the CASP1 variant in an NF-κB reporter luciferase assay induced increased NF-κB activation in a RIP2-dependent manner. The disease course of the patient was complicated by severe recurrent MAS. However, dual IL-1 and IL-6 blockade caused disease remission.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">For the first time, we demonstrate the involvement of a CASP1 variant in sJIA and recurrent MAS. This variant is gain-of-function for both inflammasome and NF-κB activation leading to increased production of IL-6, IL-1β and IL-18. Although dual IL-1 and IL-6 blockade may be beneficial in patients, in whom single treatment is not sufficient to control MAS, caution should be practiced, since interstitial lung disease may progress despite apparent clinical and biochemical remission.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2020.

To date, no vasculitis associated with XIAP deficiency has been reported. A 10-year-old boy was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and he responded poorly to conventional treatment for Crohn's disease. He was dependent on corticosteroids and parenteral nutrition. To manage severe colitis, he underwent ileostomy followed by ileocolectomy for an ileo-sigmoid fistula. At the age of 15 years, he developed IgA vasculitis and at the age of 17 years, he developed refractory Takayasu arteritis (TAK), which was resistant to corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel mutation of the splice acceptor site in XIAP (c.1057-1G &gt; A) at the age of 19 years. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was successful with subsequent withdrawal of intensive immunosuppressive therapy and clinical remission of both enterocolitis and TAK. This case suggests that patients with XIAP deficiency could develop intractable inflammatory disease involving the intestinal tract and blood vessels.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, exhaustive research to assess the bacteria in the lung in AAV and in sarcoidosis have not been performed. We sought to elucidate the distinct dysbiotic lung microbiota between AAV and sarcoidosis. We used 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to obtain the bacterial community composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in patients with AAV (n = 16) compared to patients with sarcoidosis (n = 21). The patients had not undergone therapy with immunosuppressive medication when their BALF was acquired. No difference was observed in α-diversity between patients with AAV and patients with sarcoidosis when using all the detected taxa. We defined the taxa of the oral cavity by using the data of oral microbiota of healthy individuals from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). The analysis using only oral taxa made the difference in α-diversity between AAV and sarcoidosis clearer compared with those using all the detected taxa. Besides, the analysis using detected taxa except for oral taxa also made the difference in α-diversity between AAV and sarcoidosis clearer compared with those using all the detected taxa. A linear negative relationship between the α-diversity and Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS) was detected in the AAV group. The observed p-value for the effect of the disease groups on the ß-diversity was small while the effect of other factors including sex and smoking status did not have small p-values. By excluding oral taxa from all the detected taxa, we found a cluster mainly consisted of sarcoidosis patients which was characterized with microbial community monopolized by Erythrobacteraceae family. Our results suggested the importance of considering the influence of oral microbiota in evaluating lung microbiota.</AbstractText> "

In this study, AMPK levels positively correlated with many inflammatory indexes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, especially in the affected synovium. In RA sera, a positive correlation between phosphorylated (p-)AMPK-α1 levels and DAS28 (disease activity score 28) activity (r = 0.270, p &lt; 0.0001) was found. Similarly, a positive correlation was observed between AMPK-α1 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels (r = 0.460, p = 0.0002). Differentially expressed genes between osteoarthritis (OA) and RA synovium from NCBI GEO profiles and our RNA sequencing data suggested activation of metabolic pathways specific to RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). AMPK-α1 was highly expressed in the synovium of RA but not OA patients. An AMPK activator, metformin, inhibited FLS proliferation at higher but not lower concentrations, whereas the inhibitor dorsomorphin promoted the proliferation of RA-FLSs. Interestingly, both metformin and dorsomorphin inhibited the migration of RA-FLSs. After metformin treatment, expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF-α, and IL-1β were significantly downregulated in RA-FLSs; however, increased expression of p-AMPK-α1, protein kinase A (PKA)-α1, and HAPLN1 (hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1) was observed. Increased levels of HAPLN1 in RA-FLSs by an AMPK activator could potentially be beneficial in protecting the joints.

The phylum Firmicutes and its derivatives (Lactobacillus_iners, Family_XI, and Finegoldia), the phylum Actinobacteria and its derivatives (unidentified_Actinobacteria, Corynebacteriales, Corynebacteriale, Corynebacterium_1, and Corynebacterium_tuberculostearicum), and the genera <i>Prevotella</i> and Corynebacterium_1 were significantly enriched in the urine of gout patients. ROC analysis indicated that the top five altered microbial genera could be reliable markers for distinguishing gout patients from healthy individuals. These findings demonstrate that there are specific alterations in the microbial diversity of gout patients. Thus, further studies on the causal relationship between gout and the urinary microbiome will offer new prospects for diagnosing, preventing, and treating gout.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Ning, Yang, Chen, Zhao, Qian, Liu, Chen and Shi.</CopyrightInformation> "

However, limited knowledge has been accumulated regarding the phenotypic outcome of the interaction between different genetic conditions identified in the same patients. We report a newborn girl with brachytelephalangic chondrodysplasia punctata (BCDP) as well as frontonasal dysplasia, ptosis, bilateral hearing loss, vertebral anomalies, and pulmonary hypoplasia who was found, by whole exome sequencing, to have a de novo pathogenic variant in RAF1 (c.770C&gt;T, [p.Ser257Leu]) and a likely pathogenic variant in SIX2 (c.760G&gt;A [p.A254T]), as well as maternal systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This case shows that BCDP is most probably not a diagnostic entity and can be associated with various conditions associated with CDP including maternal SLE.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "
"75";"32503683";"The regulation and pharmacological modulation of immune complex induced type III IFN production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells.";" <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an ongoing interferon (IFN) production due to an activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which can be triggered to type I IFN synthesis by RNA containing immune complexes (RNA-IC). Considering emerging data suggesting a role of type III IFN in the SLE disease process, we asked if RNA-IC can induce type III IFN production in pDC and how this production can be regulated.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or immune cell subsets were isolated from healthy blood donors or SLE patients and stimulated with IC containing U1 snRNP and SLE-IgG (RNA-IC). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and an interleukin receptor 1-associated kinase 4 inhibitor (IRAK4i) were added to cell cultures. Cytokine mRNA levels were determined with a microarray and protein levels with immunoassays. Single-cell RNA sequencing of pDCs using ddSEQ technology was performed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Type III IFN mRNA and protein was induced in RNA-IC-stimulated pDC-NK and pDC-B cell co-cultures. A subset of activated pDCs (3%) expressed both type III and type I IFN mRNA. IFN-λ2, IFN-α2b, interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhanced IFN-λ1/3 production 2-5-fold. HCQ and an IRAK4i blocked the RNA-IC-triggered IFN-λ1/3 production (p &lt; 0.01). IFN-α2b and GM-CSF increased the proportion of SLE patients producing IFN-λ1/3 in response to RNA-IC from 11 to 33%.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Type III IFN production is triggered by RNA-IC in pDCs in a TLR-MyD88-dependent manner, enhanced by NK and B cells as well as several pro-inflammatory cytokines. These results support a contributing role for both type I and type III IFNs in SLE, which needs to be considered when targeting the IFN system in this disease.</AbstractText> "

Proresolving nonclassic macrophages (NCMs) are less responsive to type I interferon (IFN) than classic macrophages (CMs; which are proinflammatory), reflecting their relative expression levels of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR). This study was undertaken to investigate the regulation of IFNAR expression in macrophages.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We carried out gene expression profiling of purified CMs and NCMs from mice treated with pristane (which develop lupus) or mineral oil (non-lupus controls). Macrophage differentiation and IFNAR expression were examined in mice treated with NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activators and inhibitors and in Nrf2-deficient mice. Nrf2 activity was also assessed in blood cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Significant differences were determined by Student's t-test.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">RNA sequencing revealed increased expression of genes regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2 in NCMs from mineral oil-treated versus pristane-treated mice and in NCMs versus CMs. The Nrf2 activator CDDO-imidazole (CDDO-Im) decreased CMs (P &lt; 0.0001) and promoted the development of proresolving NCMs (P = 0.06), whereas the Nrf2 inhibitor brusatol increased CMs (P &lt; 0.05) and decreased NCMs (P &lt; 0.001). CDDO-Im decreased Ifnar1 (P &lt; 0.001) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in macrophages and alleviated oxidative stress (P &lt; 0.05), whereas brusatol had the opposite effect (P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, Ifnar1 and ISG expression levels were higher in Nrf2-knockout mice than controls (P &lt; 0.05). As seen in mice with lupus, SLE patients showed evidence of low Nrf2 activity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings indicate that Nrf2 activation favors the resolution of chronic inflammation in lupus. Since autoantibody production and lupus nephritis depend on IFNAR signaling, the ability of Nrf2 activators to repolarize macrophages and reduce the INF signature suggests that these agents may warrant consideration for treating lupus.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"77";"32499639";"Notch signalling drives synovial fibroblast identity and arthritis pathology.";" <AbstractText>The synovium is a mesenchymal tissue composed mainly of fibroblasts, with a lining and sublining that surround the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis the synovial tissue undergoes marked hyperplasia, becomes inflamed and invasive, and destroys the joint<sup>1,2</sup>. It has recently been shown that a subset of fibroblasts in the sublining undergoes a major expansion in rheumatoid arthritis that is linked to disease activity<sup>3-5</sup>; however, the molecular mechanism by which these fibroblasts differentiate and expand is unknown. Here we identify a critical role for NOTCH3 signalling in the differentiation of perivascular and sublining fibroblasts that express CD90 (encoded by THY1). Using single-cell RNA sequencing and synovial tissue organoids, we found that NOTCH3 signalling drives both transcriptional and spatial gradients-emanating from vascular endothelial cells outwards-in fibroblasts. In active rheumatoid arthritis, NOTCH3 and Notch target genes are markedly upregulated in synovial fibroblasts. In mice, the genetic deletion of Notch3 or the blockade of NOTCH3 signalling attenuates inflammation and prevents joint damage in inflammatory arthritis. Our results indicate that synovial fibroblasts exhibit a positional identity that is regulated by endothelium-derived Notch signalling, and that this stromal crosstalk pathway underlies inflammation and pathology in inflammatory arthritis.</AbstractText> "

This disease is characterized by cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases causes pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can be fatal. Bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and plasma from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 have been profiled using protein measurements and bulk and single cell RNA sequencing. Onset of pneumonia and ARDS can be rapid in COVID-19, suggesting a potential neuronal involvement in pathology and mortality. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives changes in immune cell-derived factors that then interact with receptors expressed by the sensory neuronal innervation of the lung to further promote important aspects of disease severity, including ARDS. We sought to quantify how immune cells might interact with sensory innervation of the lung in COVID-19 using published data from patients, existing RNA sequencing datasets from human dorsal root ganglion neurons and other sources, and a genome-wide ligand-receptor pair database curated for pharmacological interactions relevant for neuro-immune interactions. Our findings reveal a landscape of ligand-receptor interactions in the lung caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and point to potential interventions to reduce the burden of neurogenic inflammation in COVID-19 pulmonary disease. In particular, our work highlights opportunities for clinical trials with existing or under development rheumatoid arthritis and other (e.g. CCL2, CCR5 or EGFR inhibitors) drugs to treat high risk or severe COVID-19 cases.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It is clinically characterized by disproportionate short stature and early onset of degenerative osteoarthritis. Clinical diagnosis can be challenging due to the late-onset of the disease and lack of systemic metabolic abnomalites. Genetic diagnosis is critical in both early diagnosis and management of the disease. Here we reported a five-generation Chinese SEDT family and described the novel molecular findings.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Detailed family history and clinical data were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood samples of family members. The exons of genes known to be associated with skeletal disorders were captured and deep sequenced. Variants were annotated by ANNOVAR and associated with multiple databases. Putative variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. The identified variant was classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The proband was a 27-year-old Chinese male who presented with short-trunk short stature and joint pain. His radiographs showed platyspondyly with posterior humping, narrow hip-joint surfaces, and pelvic osteosclerosis. A pedigree analysis of 5 generations with 6 affected males revealed an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Affected males were diagnosed as SEDT according to the clinical and radiological features. Next-generation sequencing identified a novel variant of c.216_217del in the exon 4 of TRAPPC2 gene in the proband and other affected males. This variant resulted in the shift of reading frame and early termination of protein translation (p.S73Gfs*15). The mother and maternal female relatives of the proband were heterozygous carriers of the same variant, while no variations were detected in this gene of his father and other unaffected males. Based on the ACMG criteria, the novel c.216_217del variant of the TRAPPC2 gene was the pathogenic variant of this SEDT family.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In this study we identified the novel pathogenic variant of of c.216_217del in the gene of TRAPPC2 in this five-generation Chinese SEDT family.

The pathogenicity of the candidate mutation was also analyzed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">An AD-MED family with 10 affected members and 17 unaffected members was recruited. The main radiographic findings were symmetrical changes in the dysplastic acetabulum and femoral heads, irregular contours of the epiphyses, a shortened femoral neck, and flatfoot. Lower bone density was also observed in the ankle joints, wrist joints, and knees, as well as irregular vertebral end plates. In the proband, we identified the missense mutation c.1153G &gt; T (p. Asp385Tyr), located in exon 11 of the COMP gene. This mutation was assessed as 'pathogenic' because of its low allele frequency and its high likelihood of co-segregation with disease in the reported family.

"82";"32446935";"ANCA autoantigen gene expression highlights neutrophil heterogeneity where expression in normal-density neutrophils correlates with ANCA-induced activation.";" <AbstractText>ANCA vasculitis is an autoimmune disease with increased expression of the autoantigen genes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PRTN3), but the origin and significance of expression is less distinct. To clarify this, we measured MPO and PRTN3 messenger RNA in monocytes, normal-density neutrophils, and in enriched leukocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Increased autoantigen gene expression was detected in normal-density neutrophils and enriched leukocytes from patients during active disease compared to healthy individuals, with the largest difference in enriched leukocytes. RNA-seq of enriched leukocytes comparing active-remission pairs identified a gene signature for low-density neutrophils. Cell sorting revealed low-density neutrophils contained mature and immature neutrophils depending on the presence or absence of CD10. Both populations contributed to autoantigen expression but the frequency of immature cells in low-density neutrophils did not correlate with low-density neutrophil MPO or PRTN3 expression. Low-density neutrophils were refractory to MPO-ANCA induced oxidative burst, suggesting an alternative role for low-density neutrophils in ANCA vasculitis pathogenesis. In contrast, normal-density neutrophils were activated by MPO-ANCA and monoclonal anti-PR3 antibody. Normal-density neutrophil activation correlated with MPO and PRTN3 mRNA. Increased autoantigen gene expression originating from the mature low-density and normal-density neutrophils suggests transcriptional dysregulation is a hallmark of ANCA vasculitis. Thus, the correlation between autoantigen gene expression and antibody-mediated normal-density neutrophil activation connects autoantigen gene expression with disease pathogenesis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 International Society of Nephrology.

In recent years, multiple monogenic diseases with early onset autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation have been identified, such as autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, rat sarcoma (RAS)-associated autoimmune leukoproliferative disease, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 gain-of-function syndrome and interleukin-2 receptor α deficiency. Therefore, we performed whole-exome sequencing in children with SLE with lymphoproliferation to identify genes associated with these conditions.We enrolled 7 patients with SLE with lymphoproliferation from different families. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, laboratory and histopathologic findings, treatment, and outcome were documented. Whole-exome sequencing was performed in 7 patients and their families. Suspected variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Protein levels were detected in patients with gene mutations by western blot.Four patients were male, and 3 were female. No consanguinity was reported within the 7 families. The average age at onset was 5.0 years (range: 1.2-10.0 years). The most common features were renal (7/7 patients) and hematologic (6/7 patients) involvement and recurrent fever (6/7 patients), while only 2 patients presented with skin involvement. Antinuclear antibodies at a titer of ≥1:320 were positive in all patients. All patients fulfilled four 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology (EULAR/ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE. We identified a somatic activating NRAS variant (c.38 A&gt;G, p.G13C) in peripheral venous blood from 4 patients, at levels ranging from 8.8% to 42.8% in variant tissues that were absent from their parents. B cell lymphoma (BCL)-2-interacting mediator of cell death levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 4 patients were markedly reduced, whereas those in the control were normal. Another 2 mutations, c.559C&gt;T (p.Q187X) in the TNFAIP3 gene and c.3061G&gt;A (p.E1021K) in the PIK3CD gene were detected in 2 patients.The SLE is a novel phenotype of somatic mutations in the NRAS gene and germline mutations in the PI3CKD gene. These genes, NRAS, TNFAIP3, and PIK3CD, should be considered candidates for children with SLE with lymphoproliferation. If patients with SLE and lymphoproliferation present with renal and hematologic involvement and recurrent fever, they need gene testing, especially male patients.</AbstractText> "

Bisulfite sequencing allows the generation of high-throughput methylation profiles at single-base resolution of DNA. However, optimally modeling and analyzing these sparse and discrete sequencing data is still very challenging due to variable read depth, missing data patterns, long-range correlations, data errors, and confounding from cell type mixtures. We propose a regression-based hierarchical model that allows covariate effects to vary smoothly along genomic positions and we have built a specialized EM algorithm, which explicitly allows for experimental errors and cell type mixtures, to make inference about smooth covariate effects in the model. Simulations show that the proposed method provides accurate estimates of covariate effects and captures the major underlying methylation patterns with excellent power. We also apply our method to analyze data from rheumatoid arthritis patients and controls.

MiR-145 modulation induces profound changes in the human articular chondrocyte (HAC) phenotype, partially through direct repression of <i>SOX9</i>. Since miRNAs can simultaneously silence multiple targets, we aimed to identify the whole targetome of miR-145 in HACs, critical if miR-145 is to be considered a target for cartilage repair. We performed RIP-seq (RNA-immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing) of miRISC (miRNA-induced silencing complex) in HACs overexpressing miR-145 to identify miR-145 direct targets and used cWords to assess enrichment of miR-145 seed matches in the identified targets. Further validations were performed by RT-qPCR, Western immunoblot, and luciferase assays. MiR-145 affects the expression of over 350 genes and directly targets more than 50 mRNAs through the 3'UTR or, more commonly, the coding region. MiR-145 targets DUSP6, involved in cartilage organization and development, at the translational level. DUSP6 depletion leads to MMP13 upregulation, suggesting a contribution towards the effect of miR-145 on MMP13 expression. In conclusion, miR-145 directly targets several genes involved in the expression of the extracellular matrix and inflammation in primary chondrocytes. Thus, we propose miR-145 as an important regulator of chondrocyte function and a new target for cartilage repair.</AbstractText> "

This study focused on the prevalence, molecular characteristics and antimicrobial resistance pheno- and genotypes of MRSP isolated from conjunctival swabs of dogs and cats. Conjunctival swabs were collected from 72 dogs and 24 cats suffering from conjunctivitis/blepharitis, keratitis or uveitis and screened for the presence of MRSP. S. pseudintermedius was isolated from 38 (39.6 %) of all samples. Three (7.9 %) S. pseudintermedius isolates were confirmed as MRSP. They harboured the mecA gene and originated from dogs. One MRSP isolate was from a case of uveitis while the other two MRSP isolates originated from cases of conjunctivitis/blepharitis. All MRSP isolates were subjected to broth microdilution and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Resistance and virulence genes, multilocus sequence (MLS), spa, dru and SCCmec types were deduced from WGS data. Two of the three MRSP isolates, IMT360/16 and IMT515/16, shared the same MLS type (ST71), spa type (t02), dru type (dt9a), SCCmec type (II-III), and indistinguishable multidrug resistance pheno- and genotypes, including resistance to β-lactams (blaZ, mecA), erythromycin and clindamycin (erm(B)), streptomycin (aphA3), gentamicin (aacA-aphD), enrofloxacin (mutations in grlA and gyrA), tetracycline (tet(K)), and trimethoprim (dfrG)/sulfamethoxazole. The third isolate, IMT1670/16, differed in all those characteristics (MLST (ST1403), dru type (dt10h), SCCmec type (IVg), except the spa type (t02).

Drug combinations that act synergistically with each another is an effective strategy in RA therapy. In this study, we aimed to establish a new strategy to search effective synergized compounds from Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) used in RA. Based on multi-information integrative approaches, imperatorin (IMP) and β-sitosterol (STO) were predicted as the most effective pair for RA therapy. Further animal experiments demonstrated that IMP+STO treatment ameliorated arthritis severity of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats in a synergistic manner, whereas IMP or STO administration separately had no such effect. RNA sequencing and IPA analysis revealed that the synergistic mechanism of IMP+STO treatment was related to its regulatory effect on 5 canonical signaling pathways, which were not found when IMP or STO used alone. Moreover, LTA, CD83, and SREBF1 were 3 important targets for synergistic mechanism of IMP+STO treatment. The levels of these 3 genes were significantly up-regulated in IMP+STO group compared to model group, whereas IMP or STO administration separately had no effect on them. In conclusion, this study found that IMP and STO were 2 synergistic compounds from the CHM in RA therapy, whose synergistic mechanism was closely related to regulate the levels of LTA, CD83, and SREBF1.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Authors.

Macrophages play principal role in development of synovitis. Our earlier study suggests that interaction between cartilage fragments and macrophages exacerbates osteoarthritic process. However, molecular mechanisms by which cartilage fragments trigger cellular responses remain to be investigated. Therefore, the current study aims at analyzing molecular response of macrophages to cartilage fragments. To this end, we analyzed the transcriptional profiling of murine macrophages exposed to cartilage fragments by RNA sequencing. A total 153 genes were differentially upregulated, and 105 genes were down-regulated in response to cartilage fragments. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the most significantly enriched terms of the upregulated genes included scavenger receptor activity, integrin binding activity, TNF signaling, and toll-like receptor signaling. To further confirm our results, immunohistochemical staining was performed to detected regulated molecules in synovial tissues of OA patients. In consistence with RNA-seq results, MARCO, TLR2 and ITGα5 were mainly detected in the intima lining layer of synovial tissues. Moreover, blockade of TLR2 or ITGα5 but not Marco using specific antibody significantly reduced production of TNF-α in stimulated macrophages by cartilage fragments. Our data suggested that blocking TLR2 or ITGα5 might be promising therapeutic strategy for treating progressive osteoarthritis.</AbstractText> "

LncRNA expression profiles were obtained from the synovial tissues of five RA patients and five age-/gender-matched controls by RNA-Seq. Six candidate lncRNAs were then chosen and their levels in synovial fluid further examined in 25 RA patients and 25 health controls using RT-qPCR. The effects of lncRNA RP11-83J16.1 overexpression and knockdown on RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) function, inflammation state, and URI1, FRAT1, and β-catenin levels were assessed. After RNA-Seq, lncRNA expression profiles clearly distinguished RA patients from controls, and 190 upregulated lncRNAs and 131 downregulated lncRNAs were identified, which were mainly enriched in proliferative/immune/inflammatory pathways. Results of RT-qPCR showed that the levels of lncRNAs MTCO2P12, KCNQ5-IT1 and RP11-83J16.1 were increased, whereas lncRNAs LINC00570, RP11-342M1.6, and REXO1L4P were decreased in RA patients compared to controls. Notably, lncRNA RP11-83J16.1 correlated with increased inflammation and disease activity in RA patients. Additionally, lncRNA RP11-83J16.1 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammation, reduced apoptosis, and positively regulates cellular URI1, FRAT1 and β-catenin expression in RA-FLS. Rescue experiments revealed that URI1 overexpression compensated for the regulatory effects of lncRNA RP11-83J16.1 knockdown in RA-FLS. In conclusion, lncRNA RP11-83J16.1, a novel lncRNA identified by RNA-Seq, correlates with increased risk and disease activity of RA, and promotes RA-FLS proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammation by regulating URI1 and downstream β-catenin pathway components.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>AJTR Copyright © 2020.</CopyrightInformation> "

He remained relatively well until age 28 when he presented with a two-week history of fatigue, sore throat, fever and productive cough. He was found to have EBV viraemia and splenomegaly and a diagnosis of EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disease was made following bone marrow trephine. Family history was notable with three siblings: a healthy sister and two brothers with anaemia and neutropaenia; one who succumbed to septicaemia secondary to neutropaenic enterocolitis age 5 and another who developed intestinal vasculitis and antibody deficiency and had a successful haemopoetic stem cell transplant. The proband's DNA underwent targeted sequencing of 279 genes associated with immunodeficiency (GRID panel). The best candidates were two ADA2 variants, p.Arg169Gln (R169Q) and p.Asn370Lys (N370K). Sanger sequencing and co-segregation of variants in the parents, unaffected sister and all three affected brothers was fully consistent with compound heterozygous inheritance. Subsequent whole genome sequencing of the proband identified no other potential causal variants. ADA2 activity was consistent with a diagnosis of ADA2 deficiency in affected family members. This is the first description of EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disease in ADA2 deficiency. ADA2 deficiency may cause susceptibility to severe EBV-induced disease and we would recommend that EBV status and viral load is monitored in patients with this diagnosis and allogeneic SCT is considered at an early stage for patients whose ADA2 deficiency is associated with significant complications.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated whether circRNAs function as competing endogenous RNAs to regulate the pathological process of temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA). High-throughput sequencing of mRNA (RNA seq) was performed to detect the expression of circRNAs in TMJOA and control synovial tissues isolated from humans. The differentially upregulated circGCN1L1 (hsa_circ_0000448) in synoviocyte was validated in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate the interactions between circGCN1L1 and both miR-330-3p and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) through bioinformatics predictions, luciferase report assays, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. mRNA expression profiles of TNF-α-stimulated synoviocyte showed that circGCN1L1 and p65 expressions were upregulated by TNF-α. Moreover, miR-330-3p was negatively correlated with TNF-α secretion. Further, we found that miR-330-3p directly targeted TNF and restrained the production of matrix-degrading enzymes (MMP3, MMP13, and ADAMTS4). Mechanistic studies unveiled that circGCN1L1 in TMJOA synovial tissues and cells may be associated with condylar chondrocyte apoptosis and synoviocyte hyperplasia. Moreover, intra-articular injection of shcircGCN1L1 alleviated TMJOA progression in rat models. Altogether, we elucidated the important roles of a novel circRNA, namely, circGCN1L1, which induced inflammation in TMJ synoviocytes and decreased anabolism of the extracellular matrix (ECM) through miR-330-3p and TNF-α gene. This circRNA may represent a potentially effective therapeutic strategy against TMJOA progression at an early stage.</AbstractText> "
"95";"32332252";"Sensitization of knee-innervating sensory neurons by tumor necrosis factor-α-activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes: an in vitro, coculture model of inflammatory pain.";" <AbstractText>Pain is a principal contributor to the global burden of arthritis with peripheral sensitization being a major cause of arthritis-related pain. Within the knee joint, distal endings of dorsal root ganglion neurons (knee neurons) interact with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and the inflammatory mediators they secrete, which are thought to promote peripheral sensitization. Correspondingly, RNA sequencing has demonstrated detectable levels of proinflammatory genes in FLS derived from arthritis patients. This study confirms that stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) results in expression of proinflammatory genes in mouse and human FLS (derived from osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients), as well as increased secretion of cytokines from mouse TNF-α-stimulated FLS (TNF-FLS). Electrophysiological recordings from retrograde labelled knee neurons cocultured with TNF-FLS, or supernatant derived from TNF-FLS, revealed a depolarized resting membrane potential, increased spontaneous action potential firing, and enhanced TRPV1 function, all consistent with a role for FLS in mediating the sensitization of pain-sensing nerves in arthritis. Therefore, data from this study demonstrate the ability of FLS activated by TNF-α to promote neuronal sensitization, results that highlight the importance of both nonneuronal and neuronal cells to the development of pain in arthritis.</AbstractText> "

Previous studies showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) harbor many viral communities. However, little is known about the viral components and the expression profiles of SLE-associated virome. We aimed to identify viral taxonomic markers of SLE that might be used in the detection of disease or in predicting its outcome. <b>Methods:</b> Non-human sequence data from high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of PBMC samples from 10 SLE patients and 10 healthy individuals were used for taxonomic alignment against an integrated virome reference genome database. Based on abundance profiles of SLE-associated virome species, genera, or host, Random Forests model was used to identify the viruses associated with SLE diagnostic markers. Spearman's correlation and functional clustering was used to analyze the interaction of candidate virome dysbiosis and SLE-associated differentially expressed genes. <b>Results:</b> A total of 419 viruses (38 human associated viruses, 350 phage, and 31 other viruses) was detected and the diversity of the PBMC virome was significantly increased in patients with SLE compared to the healthy controls (HCs). Viral taxa discriminated the cases from the controls, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.883, 0.695, and 0.540 for species, genus, and host, respectively. Clinical subgroup analysis showed that candidate PBMC viral markers were associated with stable- and active-stage SLE. Functional analyses showed that virome dysbiosis was mainly relevant to cellular and metabolic processes. <b>Conclusion:</b> We identified virome signatures associated with SLE, which might help develop tools to identify SLE patients or predict the disease stage.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Guo, Ye, Shi, Yan, Huang, Lin, Xing, Ye, Wu, Li, Chen, Xue and Zhang.</CopyrightInformation> "

In China, the disease is characterized by infectious synovitis and arthritis. However, the mechanism by which MS causes infectious synovitis and arthritis remains unknown. Increasing evidence suggests that synovial fibroblasts (SF) play a key role in the pathogenesis of arthritis. Here, both RNA sequencing and tandem mass tag analyses are utilized to compare the response of primary chicken SF (CSF) following infection with and without MS. The host response between non-infected and infected cells was remarkably different at both the mRNA and protein levels. In total, 2,347 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (upregulated, <i>n</i> = 1,137; downregulated, <i>n</i> = 1,210) and 221 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (upregulated, <i>n</i> = 129; downregulated, <i>n</i> = 92) were detected in the infected group. A correlation analysis indicated a moderate positive correlation between the mRNA and protein level changes in MS-infected CSF. At both the transcriptomic and proteomic levels, 149 DEGs were identified; 88 genes were upregulated and 61 genes were downregulated in CSF. Additionally, part of these regulated genes and their protein products were grouped into seven categories: proliferation-related and apoptosis-related factors, inflammatory mediators, proangiogenic factors, antiangiogenic factors, matrix metalloproteinases, and other arthritis-related proteins. These proteins may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS-induced arthritis in chickens. To our knowledge, this is the first integrated analysis on the mechanism of CSF-MS interactions that combined transcriptomic and proteomic technologies. In this study, many key candidate genes and their protein products related to MS-induced infectious synovitis and arthritis were identified.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Liu, Xu, Yu, Zhang, Sun, Liu, Lu, Pan and Zhang.</CopyrightInformation> "

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon that lacks satisfactory treatment. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of low-dose IL-2 as a therapeutic for UC on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. <b>Methods</b>: Mice with DSS-induced colitis were intraperitoneally injected with low-dose IL-2. Survival, body weight, disease activity index, colon length, histopathological score, myeloperoxidase activity and inflammatory cytokine levels as well as intestinal barrier integrity were examined. Differential gene expression after low-dose IL-2 treatment was analyzed by RNA-sequencing. <b>Results</b>: Low-dose IL-2 significantly improved the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice and attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell infiltration. The most effective dose range of IL-2 was 16K-32K IU/day. Importantly, low-dose IL-2 was effective in ameliorating the disruption of epithelial barrier integrity in DSS-induced colitis tissues by restoring tight junction proteins and mucin production and suppressing apoptosis. The colon tissue of DSS-induced mice exposed to low-dose IL-2 mimic gene expression patterns in the colons of control mice. Furthermore, we identified the crucial role of the PI3K-AKT pathway in exerting the therapeutic effect of low-dose IL-2. <b>Conclusions</b>: The results of our study suggest that low-dose IL-2 has therapeutic effects on DSS-induced colitis and potential clinical value in treating UC.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The author(s).</CopyrightInformation> "

Rheumatic and autoimmune diseases could be accompanied by secondary TMA; in fact, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a common disease associated with secondary TMA, and SLE complicated with TMA has been reported to have a poor prognosis. Although TMA occurs rarely in pediatric SLE patients, it often leads to severe clinical conditions. Here, we report a rare case of severe juvenile-onset SLE complicated with TMA and kidney injury. The 5-year-old patient showed renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, nephrotic syndrome, hypocomplementemia, and elevation of anti-dsDNA IgG levels. Kidney biopsy revealed mesangial proliferation and endocapillary proliferation, as well as plumped endothelial cells, with full-house pattern deposits in immunofluorescence study. Combination treatment of methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by oral prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and plasma exchange was effective, whereas eculizumab did not show therapeutic effects. The patient further showed recurrent deterioration, and we initiated intravenous cyclophosphamide in addition to combination treatment and eventually succeeded in controlling the disease. Genome analysis by whole-exome sequencing revealed no particular gene mutation related to either complement disorders or type-1 interferon. Further elucidations concerning the pathogenic mechanisms causing juvenile-onset SLE are needed to establish an efficient treatment strategy for TMA with SLE.</AbstractText> "

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations have repeatedly confirmed genetic loci including those encoding uric acid transporters such as ABCG2 and SLC9A2. However, many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in GWASs have been common variants with small effects and unknown functions. In addition, there is still much heritability to be explained. To identify the causative genetic variants for SUA concentrations in Korean subjects, we conducted a GWAS (1902 males) and validation study (2912 males and females) and found four genetic loci reaching genome-wide significance on chromosomes 4 (ABCG2) and 11 (FRMD8, EIF1AD and SLC22A12-NRXN2). Three loci on chromosome 11 were distributed within a distance of 1.3 megabases and they were in weak or moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) states (r2 = 0.02-0.68). In a subsequent association analysis on the GWAS loci of chromosome 11 using closely positioned markers derived from whole genome sequencing data, the most significant variant to be linked with the nearby GWAS signal was rs121907892 (c.774G&gt;A, p.W258*) of the SLC22A12 gene. This variant, and each of the three GWAS SNPs, were in LD (r2 = 0.06-0.32). The strength of association of SNPs with SUA concentration (negative logarithm of P-values) and the genetic distance (r2 of LD) between rs121907892 and the surrounding SNPs showed a quantitative correlation.

"107";"32265907";"In Human Autoimmunity, a Substantial Component of the B Cell Repertoire Consists of Polyclonal, Barely Mutated IgG<sup>+ve</sup> B Cells.";" <AbstractText>B cells are critical for promoting autoimmunity and the success of B cell depletion therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) confirms their importance in driving chronic inflammation. Whilst disease specific autoantibodies are useful diagnostically, our understanding of the pathogenic B cell repertoire remains unclear. Defining it would lead to novel insights and curative treatments. To address this, we have undertaken the largest study to date of over 150 RA patients, utilizing next generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze up to 200,000 BCR sequences per patient. The full-length antigen-binding variable region of the heavy chain (IgGHV) of the IgG B cell receptor (BCR) were sequenced. Surprisingly, RA patients do not express particular clonal expansions of B cells at diagnosis. Rather they express a polyclonal IgG repertoire with a significant increase in BCRs that have barely mutated away from the germline sequence. This pattern remains even after commencing disease modifying therapy. These hypomutated BCRs are expressed by TNF-alpha secreting IgG<sup>+ve</sup>CD27<sup>-ve</sup> B cells, that are expanded in RA peripheral blood and enriched in the rheumatoid synovium. A similar B cell repertoire is expressed by patients with Sjögren's syndrome. A rate limiting step in the initiation of autoimmunity is the activation of B cells and this data reveals that a sizeable component of the human autoimmune B cell repertoire consists of polyclonal, hypomutated IgG<sup>+ve</sup> B cells, that may play a critical role in driving chronic inflammation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Cowan, Miles, Capitani, Giguere, Johnsson, Goodyear, McInnes, Breusch, Gray and Gray.</CopyrightInformation> "

Here we sought to identify changes in mRNA and lncRNA levels associated with activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the predominant source of extracellular matrix production in the liver and key to NAFLD-related fibrogenesis. We performed expression profiling of mRNA and lncRNA from LX-2 cells, an immortalized human HSC cell line, treated to induce phenotypes resembling quiescent and myofibroblastic states. We identified 1964 mRNAs (1377 upregulated and 587 downregulated) and 1460 lncRNAs (665 upregulated and 795 downregulated) showing statistically significant evidence (FDR ≤0.05) for differential expression (fold change ≥|2|) between quiescent and activated states. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes showed enrichment for hepatic fibrosis (FDR = 1.35E-16), osteoarthritis (FDR = 1.47E-14), and axonal guidance signaling (FDR = 1.09E-09). We observed 127 lncRNAs/nearby mRNA pairs showing differential expression, the majority of which were dysregulated in the same direction. A comparison of differentially expressed transcripts in LX-2 cells with RNA-sequencing results from NAFLD patients with or without liver fibrosis revealed 1047 mRNAs and 91 lncRNAs shared between the two datasets, suggesting that some of the expression changes occurring during HSC activation can be observed in biopsied human tissue. These results identify lncRNA and mRNA expression patterns associated with activated human HSCs that appear to recapitulate human NAFLD fibrosis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation> "
"109";"32256724";"Transcriptome sequencing reveals dynamic changes in matrix metalloproteinases in facet joint osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis is a general joint disease characterized by articular cartilage degeneration. The extracellular matrix is a principal component in articular cartilage. The dynamic remodeling of the extracellular matrix is involved in the pathological degradation of the articular cartilage. Facet joint osteoarthritis (FJOA) is a common form of osteoarthritis that occurs in the posterior aspect of the vertebral column. However, to the best of our knowledge, the current understanding of the genetic changes in FJOA is limited. The most significantly differentially expressed genes and Gene Ontology categories in FJOA were identified by transcriptome sequencing analysis. The extracellular matrix, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and proteinases of the extracellular matrix were highly involved in FJOA. The canonical signaling pathway 'inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases' was further studied in detail by identifying and validating differentially expressed genes in the signaling pathway. Taken together, the present study revealed changes in MMP-related genes in FJOA and showed the importance of extracellular matrix remodeling in FJOA from a genetic aspect.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © Chen et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

To characterize the mechanisms underlying pulmonary EGPA, we examined and compared EGPA paraffin-embedded lung biopsies with normal lung biopsies, using immunostaining, RNA sequencing, and RT-PCR. The results revealed novel type 2 as well as immuneregulatory features. These features included basophils and increased mast cell contents; increased immunostaining for tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14; sparse mast cell degranulation; numerous forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3)+ regulatory T cells and IgG4 plasma cells; and abundant arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase and 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 α hydroxylase, mitochondrial. Significantly decreased 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase [NAD(<sup>+</sup>)], which degrades eicosanoids, was observed in EGPA samples. In addition, there was significantly increased mRNA for chemokine (C-C motif) ligands 18 and 13 and major collagen genes, IgG4-rich immune complexes coating alveolar macrophages, and increased immunostaining for phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/SMAD2, suggesting transforming growth factor-β activation. These findings suggest a novel self-promoting mechanism of activation of alveolar macrophages by arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids to express chemokines that recruit a combined type 2/immunoregulatory immune response, which produces these eicosanoids. These results suggest that the pulmonary EGPA immune response resembles the immune response to a tissue-invasive parasite infection.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 American Society for Investigative Pathology.

The cell morphology, immunophenotype, self-renewal, multi-differentiation, and cell migration of these CPCs were evaluated. Additionally, the distributions of CD105<sup>+</sup>/CD271<sup>+</sup> cells in OA osteochondral specimen were determined.

The mCPCs from grade 3-4 cartilages (mCPCs, grades 3-4) harbored morphological characteristics, cell proliferation, and colony formation capacity that were similar to those of the mCPCs from the grade 1-2 OA cartilages (mCPCs, grades 1-2). However, the mCPCs (grades 3-4) highly expressed CD271. In addition, the mCPCs (grades 3-4) showed enhanced osteo-adipogenic activities and decreased chondrogenic capacity. Furthermore, the mCPCs (grades 3-4) exhibited stronger cell migration in response to osteoarthritis synovial fluids.

The basis for this transition is unknown. To evaluate a role for lymphocyte polarization, we characterized T cells from patients with acute and chronic sJIA using flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and RNA sequencing. Acute and chronic sJIA each featured an expanded population of activated Tregs uncommon in healthy controls or in children with nonsystemic JIA. In acute sJIA, Tregs expressed IL-17A and a gene expression signature reflecting Th17 polarization. In chronic sJIA, the Th17 transcriptional signature was identified in T effector cells (Teffs), although expression of IL-17A at the protein level remained rare. Th17 polarization was abrogated in patients responding to IL-1 blockade. These findings identify evolving Th17 polarization in sJIA that begins in Tregs and progresses to Teffs, likely reflecting the impact of the cytokine milieu and consistent with a biphasic model of disease pathogenesis. The results support T cells as a potential treatment target in sJIA.</AbstractText> "

We reported a case with a loss-of-function mutation in DNASE1L3, a gene described previously in families with systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, the patient showed a novel homozygous missense variant in DOCK8, a gene known to be responsible for the hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome (HIES). A 3-year-old girl born to consanguine parents presented with chronic urticarial rash, hemolytic anemia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hypovolemic shock findings. She had a low hemoglobin level, a positive direct antiglobulin test, antinuclear antibody and anti-double stranded DNA, low C3 and C4, third-degree tricuspid regurgitation, and severe enlargement of the right ventricle on echocardiography, suggesting pulmonary embolism. Despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, pulse metilprednisolone, rituximab, and supportive treatment for shock, the patient died on the seventh day. Whole-exome sequencing indicated a homozygous stop variant c.537G&gt;A (p. Trp179Ter) in DNASE1L3. In addition, a possibly pathogenic homozygous missense variant in the HIES gene DOCK8 was detected.

For the study, total number of 182 patients with FMF disease were enrolled and screening of a panel of genes , called &quot;fever panel&quot; which comprises 17 genes, was performed. The most common mutations in MEFV gene were homozygous M694V missense mutation (4.3%) and R202Q missense mutation (4.9%). The most common heterozygous mutations were R202Q (26.5%), M694V (25.9%) and E148Q (11.9%). Compound heterozygous and homozygous mutations were also detected. Also, different types of mutations were identified in NOD2, CARD14, NLRP12, NLRP3, NLRP7, IL1RN, LPIN2, TNFRSF1A, MVK and PSTPIP1 genes. Two novel missense variations in the MEFV gene, Gln34Pro and Ile247Val, which have not been previously reported in the databases, were identified. Also, Thr91Ile missense variation in the NOD2 gene, Gly461Cys missense variation in NLRP3 and Tyr732Stop nonsense variation in LPIN2 were firstly identified. The results of the current study suggest that in addition to the MEFV gene which has an important roles in FMF, molecular screening of other genes related to other autoinflammatory diseases might provide support in suspected cases and provide detailed information about the course of the disease.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

"116";"32196497";"Exploring the overlap between rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility loci and long non-coding RNA annotations.";" <AbstractText>Whilst susceptibility variants for many complex diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have been well characterised, the mechanism by which risk is mediated is still unclear for many loci. This is especially true for the majority of variants that do not affect protein-coding regions. lncRNA represent a group of molecules that have been shown to be enriched amongst variants associated with RA and other complex diseases, compared to random variants. In order to establish to what degree direct disruption of lncRNA may represent a potential mechanism for mediating RA susceptibility, we chose to further explore this overlap. By testing the ability of annotated features to improve a model of disease susceptibility, we were able to demonstrate a local enrichment of enhancers from immune-relevant cell types amongst RA susceptibility variants (log2 enrichment 3.40). This was not possible for lncRNA annotations in general, however a small, but significant enrichment was observed for immune-enriched lncRNA (log2 enrichment 0.867002). This enrichment was no longer apparent when the model was conditioned on immune-relevant enhancers (log2 enrichment -0.372734), suggesting that direct disruption of lncRNA sequence, independent of enhancer disruption, does not represent a major mechanism by which susceptibility to complex diseases is mediated. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, in keeping with general lncRNA characteristics, immune-enriched lncRNA are expressed at low levels that may not be amenable to functional characterisation.</AbstractText> "
"117";"32191636";"E4BP4-mediated inhibition of T follicular helper cell differentiation is compromised in autoimmune diseases.";" <AbstractText>T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are indispensable for the formation of germinal center (GC) reactions, whereas T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells inhibit Tfh-mediated GC responses. Aberrant activation of Tfh cells contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms mitigating excessive Tfh cell differentiation are not fully understood. Herein we demonstrate that the adenovirus E4 promoter-binding protein (E4BP4) mediates a feedback loop and acts as a transcriptional brake to inhibit Tfh cell differentiation. Furthermore, we show that such an immunological mechanism is compromised in patients with SLE. Establishing mice with either conditional knockout (cKO) or knockin (cKI) of the E4bp4 gene in T cells reveals that E4BP4 strongly inhibits Tfh cell differentiation. Mechanistically, E4BP4 regulates Bcl6 transcription by recruiting the repressive epigenetic modifiers HDAC1 and EZH2. E4BP4 phosphorylation site mutants have limited capability with regard to inhibiting Tfh cell differentiation. In SLE, we detected impaired phosphorylation of E4BP4, finding that this compromised transcription factor is positively correlated with disease activity. These findings unveiled molecular mechanisms by which E4BP4 restrains Tfh cell differentiation, whose compromised function is associated with uncontrolled autoimmune reactions in SLE.</AbstractText> "

The unlimited source of cells capable of differentiating to chondrocytes has potential for repairing damaged cartilage or to generate disease models via gene editing. However their use is limited by the efficiency of chondrogenic differentiation. An improved understanding of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of chondrogenesis will enable us to improve hESC chondrogenic differentiation protocols. Small RNA-seq and whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on distinct stages of hESC-directed chondrogenesis. This revealed significant changes in the expression of several microRNAs including upregulation of known cartilage associated microRNAs and those transcribed from the Hox complexes, and the downregulation of pluripotency associated microRNAs. Integration of miRomes and transcriptomes generated during hESC-directed chondrogenesis identified key functionally related clusters of co-expressed microRNAs and protein coding genes, associated with pluripotency, primitive streak, limb development and extracellular matrix. Analysis identified regulators of hESC-directed chondrogenesis such as miR-29c-3p with 10 of its established targets identified as co-regulated 'ECM organisation' genes and miR-22-3p which is highly co-expressed with ECM genes and may regulate these genes indirectly by targeting the chondrogenic regulators SP1 and HDAC4. We identified several upregulated transcription factors including HOXA9/A10/D13 involved in limb patterning and RELA, JUN and NFAT5, which have targets enriched with ECM associated genes. We have developed an unbiased approach for integrating transcriptome and miRome using protein-protein interactions, transcription factor regulation and miRNA target interactions and identified key regulatory networks prominent in hESC chondrogenesis.</AbstractText> "

All cases had established imaging and histopathological diagnosis of STABC and were subject to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for USP6 rearrangement and Archer® FusionPlex® targeted RNA sequencing (RNASeq) analysis to identify the fusion partner. A thorough literature review of STABC and MO was conducted. The patients presented with painful masses unpreceded by trauma, occurring most commonly in the deep soft tissue of the thigh/gluteus (4/7), and also in the supraclavicular region, the axilla, and the hand. On imaging, the lesions were frequently associated with peripheral calcification on conventional radiographs and CT (6/7), cystic components on ultrasound, as well as perilesional edema (7/7) and fluid levels (3/7) on MRI. Bone scan (1/1) showed intense radiotracer uptake. Histologically, 6/7 cases demonstrated zonal arrangements reminiscent of MO. USP6 rearrangement was found in all seven cases by FISH and/or RNASeq. RNASeq further detected COL1A1-USP6 fusion in six cases and a novel ANGPTL2-USP6 fusion in one case. Four patients underwent resection of the tumors and were disease free at their last follow-up. Three patients who underwent incisional or needle biopsies had no evidence of disease progression on imaging studies. In conclusion, the clinical, radiological, and pathological overlap between STABC and MO suggests that they are closely related entities. A novel fusion ANGPTL2-USP6 is associated with distinct clinical and pathological presentation.</AbstractText> "

This retrospective exploratory clinical study aimed to investigate the association between mutations in the MUC5B gene and clinical outcome in patients with RA, with or without RA-ILD, using whole-exome sequencing (WES). MATERIAL AND METHODS WES was performed using peripheral blood samples for mutations in the MUC5B gene in 51 patients diagnosed with RA without ILD, and 45 patients with RA-ILD. The cumulative incidence in acute exacerbations of RA-ILD and variables associated with acute exacerbations of RA-ILD were analyzed. RESULTS In patients with RA-ILD, the main genetic variants of MUC5B were identified, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.410 (p=0.013). Nine patients with RA without ILD (17.6%) and 19 patients with RA-ILD (42.2%) expressed MUC5B variants. Patients with RA-ILD carrying MUC5B variants had a significantly increased duration of RA-ILD (p=0.03) and showed a UIP pattern on lung HRCT (p=0.01). Acute exacerbations of RA-ILD occurred in 25 patients during follow-up, including 13 patients with mutant MUC5B and 12 patients with wildtype MUC5B. Univariate analysis showed that MUC5B mutations (p=0.043), older age of onset of RA (p=0.041), increased serum anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) (p=0.033), and a UIP imaging pattern on HRCT (p=0.015) were significantly correlated with acute exacerbations of RA-ILD. However, these findings were not supported by multivariate analysis (p=0.065). CONCLUSIONS The carrier status of MUC5B variants was an indicator of reduced prognosis and increased exacerbations of RA-ILD.</AbstractText> "

Intra-articular delivery of purified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from MRL/MpJ &quot;superhealer&quot; mice increased bone volume during repair and prevents post-traumatic arthritis. Recently, although extracellular vesicles released from MSCs have been used widely for treating OA, the application of extracellular vesicles secreted by CPCs from MRL/MpJ mice in OA therapy has never been reported. In this study, we evaluated the effects of extracellular vesicles secreted by CPCs from control CBA (CBA-EVs) and MRL/MpJ mice (MRL-EVs) on proliferation and migration of murine chondrocytes. We also determined here if weekly intra-articular injections of CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs would repair and regenerate surgically induced model in mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">CPC surface markers were detected by flow cytometry. CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs were isolated using an ultrafiltration method. Nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and western blots were used to identify extracellular vesicles. CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs were injected intra-articularly in a mouse model of surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA, and histological and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to assess the efficacy of exosome injections. We used miRNA-seq analysis to analyze the expression profiles of exosomal miRNAs derived from CBA-EVs as well as MRL-EVs. Cell-counting and scratch assays were used to evaluate the effects of CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs on proliferation and migration of murine chondrocytes, respectively. Meanwhile, a specific RNA inhibitor assesses the roles of the candidate miRNAs in CPC-EV-induced regulation of function of chondrocytes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Both CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs stimulated chondrocyte proliferation and migration, but MRL-EVs exerted a stronger effect than CBA-EVs. The similar result was also observed in in vivo study, which indicated that injecting either CBA-EVs or MRL-EVs attenuated OA, but MRL-EVs showed a superior therapeutic effect in comparison with CBA-EVs. The results of bioinformatics analyses revealed that the differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs participated in multiple biological processes. We identified 80 significantly upregulated and 100 downregulated miRNAs. Moreover, we found that the top 20 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs connected OA repair to processes such as AMPK signaling, regulation of autophagy, and insulin signaling. Notably, miRNA 221-3p were highly enriched in MRL-Exos and treatment with miR 221-3p inhibitor markedly decreased chondrocyte proliferation and migration induced by CBA-EVs or MRL-EVs in vitro.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This is the first study to demonstrate MRL-EVs had a greater therapeutic effect on the treatment of OA than CBA-EVs. This study will hopefully provide new insight into the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of OA.</AbstractText> "

Systematically addressing T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of different CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets could help understand RA pathogenesis. Here, peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from treatment-naïve RA patients and healthy controls were sorted into seven subsets including naïve, effector, central memory, effector memory (EMT), Th1, Th17, and regulatory T cells. T-cell receptor β chain repertoires were then analyzed by next-generation sequencing. We identified T-cell clonal expansion in EMT and Th17 cells of RA patients, with highly similar TCR repertoires. Ex vivo experiments demonstrated the preferred differentiation from EMT to Th17 cells in RA. Notably, we showed that TCR diversity and abundance of differentiated T cells of Th17 were significantly correlated with RA disease activity. Based on these observations, we propose that abnormal differentiation from EMT to Th17 and expansion of Th17 play pivotal role in RA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"130";"32107493";"Proteolysis and cartilage development are activated in the synovium after surgical induction of post traumatic osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection surgery in the minipig induces post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) in a pattern similar to that seen in human patients after ACL injury. Prior studies have reported the presence of cartilage matrix-degrading proteases, such as Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 4 (ADAMTS-4), in the synovial fluid of injured or arthritic joints; however, the tissue origin of these proteases is unknown. The objective of this study was to identify transcriptional processes activated in the synovium after surgical induction of PTOA with ACL transection, and to determine if processes associated with proteolysis were enriched in the synovium after ACL transection. Unilateral ACL transection was performed in adolescent Yucatan minipigs and synovium samples were collected at 1, 5, 9, and 14 days post-injury. Transcriptome-wide gene expression levels were determined using bulk RNA-Sequencing in the surgical animals and control animals with healthy knees. The greatest number of transcripts with significant changes was observed 1 day after injury. These changes were primarily associated with cellular proliferation, consistent with measurements of increased cellularity of the synovium at the two-week time point. At five to 14 days, the expression of transcripts relating to proteolysis and cartilage development was significantly enriched. While protease inhibitor-encoding transcripts (TIMP2, TIMP3) represented the largest fraction of protease-associated transcripts in the uninjured synovium, protease-encoding transcripts (including MMP1, MMP2, ADAMTS4) predominated after surgery. Cartilage development-associated transcripts that are typically not expressed by synovial cells, such as ACAN and COMP, were enriched in the synovium following ACL-transection. The upregulation in both catabolic processes (proteolysis) and anabolic processes (cartilage development) suggests that the synovium plays a complex, balancing role in the early response to PTOA induction.</AbstractText> "

However, their role in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a condition characterized by aberrant type I IFN signaling, has not been determined. Here, we identify a nonredundant role for IFN-λ in immune dysregulation and tissue inflammation in a model of TLR7-induced lupus. IFN-λ protein is increased in murine lupus and IFN-λ receptor (Ifnlr1) deficiency significantly reduces immune cell activation and associated organ damage in the skin and kidneys without effects on autoantibody production. Single-cell RNA sequencing in mouse spleen and human peripheral blood revealed that only mouse neutrophils and human B cells are directly responsive to this cytokine. Rather, IFN-λ activates keratinocytes and mesangial cells to produce chemokines that induce immune cell recruitment and promote tissue inflammation. These data provide insights into the immunobiology of SLE and identify type III IFNs as important factors for tissue-specific pathology in this disease.</AbstractText> "

In the general community, the disease is largely polygenic in genetic architecture, with many polymorphisms having been identified in gout or urate-associated traits. In a small proportion of cases, rare high penetrant mutations associated with monogenic segregation of the disease in families have been demonstrated to be disease causative. In this study, we recruited a two-generation pedigree with early-onset gout. To elucidate the genetic predisposition, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. After comprehensive variant analyses and cosegregation testing, we identified a missense variant (c.277C&gt;A, p.L93M) in <i>SLC16A9</i>, an extremely rare variant in genetic databases. Moreover, in silico assessments showed strong pathogenicity. This variant cosegregated with the disease phenotype perfectly in the family and is located in a highly conserved functional domain. A few studies supported our results of the association between <i>SLC16A9</i> and gout and serum urate levels. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence for the association of rare missense in <i>SLC16A9</i> with early-onset gout. These findings not only expand our current understanding of gout but also may have further implications for the treatment and prevention of gout.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Xiu-Feng Huang et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

In rheumatoid arthritis, leukocyte-derived cytokines TNF and IL-17A work together, activating fibroblasts to become a dominant source of the hallmark cytokine IL-6. However, IL-17A alone has minimal effect on fibroblasts. To identify key mediators of the synergistic response to TNF and IL-17A in human synovial fibroblasts, we performed time series, dose-response, and gene-silencing transcriptomics experiments. Here we show that in combination with TNF, IL-17A selectively induces a specific set of genes mediated by factors including cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) and IκBζ (NFKBIZ). In the promoters of <i>CXCL1</i>, <i>CXCL2</i>, and <i>CXCL3</i>, we found a putative CUX1-NF-κB binding motif not found elsewhere in the genome. CUX1 and NF-κB p65 mediate transcription of these genes independent of LIFR, STAT3, STAT4, and ELF3. Transcription of <i>NFKBIZ</i>, encoding the atypical IκB factor IκBζ, is IL-17A dose-dependent, and IκBζ only mediates the transcriptional response to TNF and IL-17A, but not to TNF alone. In fibroblasts, IL-17A response depends on CUX1 and IκBζ to engage the NF-κB complex to produce chemoattractants for neutrophil and monocyte recruitment.</AbstractText> "

Necrotizing myositis caused by the bacterial pathogen <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> is a devastating human infection with a high mortality rate and few successful therapeutic options. We used dual transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of <i>S. pyogenes</i> and host skeletal muscle recovered contemporaneously from infected nonhuman primates. The <i>in vivo</i> bacterial transcriptome was strikingly remodeled compared to organisms grown <i>in vitro</i>, with significant upregulation of genes contributing to virulence and altered regulation of metabolic genes. The transcriptome of muscle tissue from infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) differed significantly from that of mock-infected animals, due in part to substantial changes in genes contributing to inflammation and host defense processes. We discovered significant positive correlations between group A streptococcus (GAS) virulence factor transcripts and genes involved in the host immune response and inflammation. We also discovered significant correlations between the magnitude of bacterial virulence gene expression <i>in vivo</i> and pathogen fitness, as assessed by previously conducted genome-wide transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS). By integrating the bacterial RNA-seq data with the fitness data generated by TraDIS, we discovered five new pathogen genes, namely, <i>S. pyogenes</i> 0281 (<i>Spy0281</i> [<i>dahA</i>]), <i>ihk-irr</i>, <i>slr</i>, <i>isp</i>, and <i>ciaH</i>, that contribute to necrotizing myositis and confirmed these findings using isogenic deletion-mutant strains. Taken together, our study results provide rich new information about the molecular events occurring in severe invasive infection of primate skeletal muscle that has extensive translational research implications.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Necrotizing myositis caused by <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> has high morbidity and mortality rates and relatively few successful therapeutic options. In addition, there is no licensed human <i>S. pyogenes</i> vaccine. To gain enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of this infection, we employed a multidimensional analysis strategy that included dual RNA-seq and other data derived from experimental infection of nonhuman primates. The data were used to target five streptococcal genes for pathogenesis research, resulting in the unambiguous demonstration that these genes contribute to pathogen-host molecular interactions in necrotizing infections. We exploited fitness data derived from a recently conducted genome-wide transposon mutagenesis study to discover significant correlation between the magnitude of bacterial virulence gene expression <i>in vivo</i> and pathogen fitness.

Here, single-cell multi-omics analysis demonstrates a shared mechanism with lymphoid malignancy in the formation of public rheumatoid factor autoantibodies responsible for mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. By combining single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing with serum antibody peptide sequencing and antibody synthesis, rare circulating B lymphocytes making pathogenic autoantibodies were found to comprise clonal trees accumulating mutations. Lymphoma driver mutations in genes regulating B cell proliferation and V(D)J mutation (CARD11, TNFAIP3, CCND3, ID3, BTG2, and KLHL6) were present in rogue B cells producing the pathogenic autoantibody. Antibody V(D)J mutations conferred pathogenicity by causing the antigen-bound autoantibodies to undergo phase transition to insoluble aggregates at lower temperatures. These results reveal a pre-neoplastic stage in human lymphomagenesis and a cascade of somatic mutations leading to an iconic pathogenic autoantibody.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Accordingly, JAK inhibitors compose a new class of drugs, among which tofacitinib and baricitinib have been approved for the treatment of RA. Periarticular bone erosions contribute considerably to the pathogenesis of RA. However, although the immunomodulatory aspect of JAK inhibition (JAKi) is well defined, the current knowledge of how JAKi influences bone homeostasis is limited. Here, we assessed the effects of the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib on bone phenotype (i) in mice during steady-state conditions or in mice with bone loss induced by (ii) estrogen-deficiency (ovariectomy) or (iii) inflammation (arthritis) to evaluate whether effects of JAKi on bone metabolism require noninflammatory/inflammatory challenge. In all three models, JAKi increased bone mass, consistent with reducing the ratio of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand/osteoprotegerin in serum. In vitro, effects of tofacitinib and baricitinib on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation were analyzed. JAKi significantly increased osteoblast function (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) but showed no direct effects on osteoclasts. Additionally, mRNA sequencing and ingenuity pathway analyses were performed in osteoblasts exposed to JAKi and revealed robust up-regulation of markers for osteoblast function, such as osteocalcin and Wnt signaling. The anabolic effect of JAKi was illustrated by the stabilization of β-catenin. In humans with RA, JAKi induced bone-anabolic effects as evidenced by repair of arthritic bone erosions. Results support that JAKi is a potent therapeutic tool for increasing osteoblast function and bone formation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

There is evidence for a predominance of macrophages with an inflammatory phenotype (M1) in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium. MicroRNAs (miRs) play a pivotal role in regulating the inflammatory response in innate immune cells and are found at dysregulated levels in RA patients. Here we explored miRs that tune the inflammatory function of M2-macrophages. <b>Methods:</b> Expression profiles of miR-221-3p and miR-155-5p were analyzed in clinical samples from RA, other inflammatory arthritis (OIA), osteoarthritis (OA), and healthy donors (HD) by qPCR. <i>In vitro</i> generated macrophages were transfected with miR-mimics and inhibitors. Transcriptome profiling through RNA-sequencing was performed on M2-macrophages overexpressing miR-221-3p mimic with or without LPS treatment. Secretion of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-8, and CXCL13 was measured in M1- and M2-macrophages upon TLR2/TLR3/TLR4-stimulation using ELISA. Inflammatory pathways including NF-κB, IRF3, MAPKs, and JAK3/STAT3 were evaluated by immunoblotting. Direct target interaction of miR-221-3p and predicted target sites in 3'UTR of JAK3 were examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. <b>Results:</b> miR-221-3p in synovial tissue and fluid was increased in RA vs. OA or OIA. Endogenous expression levels of miR-221-3p and miR-155-5p were higher in M1- than M2-macrophages derived from RA patients or HD. TLR4-stimulation of M1- and M2-macrophages resulted in downregulation of miR-221-3p, but upregulation of miR-155-5p. M2-macrophages transfected with miR-221-3p mimics secreted less IL-10 and CXCL13 but more IL-6 and IL-8, exhibited downregulation of JAK3 protein and decreased pSTAT3 activation. JAK3 was identified as new direct target of miR-221-3p in macrophages. Co-transfection of miR-221-3p/miR-155-5p mimics in M2-macrophages increased M1-specific IL-12 secretion. <b>Conclusions:</b> miR-221-3p acts as a regulator of TLR4-induced inflammatory M2-macrophage function by directly targeting JAK3.

However, population-specific HLA imputation references are essential for achieving high imputation accuracy. In this study, a subset of 1012 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) who underwent both whole-genome SNP array and NGS-based HLA typing were used to establish Taiwanese HLA imputation references. The HIBAG package was used to generate the imputation references for eight HLA loci at a two- and three-field resolution. Internal validation was carried out to evaluate the call threshold and accuracy for each HLA gene. HLA class II genes found to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were validated in this study by the imputed HLA alleles. Our Taiwanese population-specific references achieved average HLA imputation accuracies of 98.11% for two-field and 98.08% for three-field resolution. The frequency distribution of imputed HLA alleles among 23,972 TWB subjects were comparable with PCR-based HLA alleles in general Taiwanese reported in the allele frequency net database. We replicated four common HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03:01, DRB1*04:05, DQA1*03:03, and DQB1*04:01) significantly associated with RA. The population-specific references provide an informative tool to investigate the associations of HLA variants and human diseases in large-scale population-based studies.</AbstractText> "

Here we report an 11-year-old girl with a history of repeated episodes of fever, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and urticarial rash in the trunk and limbs. Chest and pelvic X-Ray, sacroiliac joints MRI, brain MRI and abdominal CT scan were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody, Rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulin, ANCA/PR3, p-ANCA/MPO, anti-smooth muscle antibody and anti-mitochondrial antibody were negative. Serology for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV viruses was negative. Serum immunoglobulins were in the normal range. Genetic analysis for familial Mediterranean fever syndrome was negative. Whole exome sequencing was carried out to identify the genetic cause of our patient. We identified a homozygous missense variant (c.579C &gt; G, p. His193Gln) in exon 7 of the PLCG2 gene. Bioinformatic analysis and clinical symptoms suggests this variant to be pathogenic in the homozygous state for APLAID and thus probably acting in an autosomal recessive manner. Our bioinformatic analysis also showed this novel mutation to have detrimental effects on the 3D structure of the PLCG2 protein, which is well conserved among many other similar species.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020.

Notably, KD is more prevalent in males than females. We previously established a key role for IL (interleukin)-1 signaling in KD pathogenesis, but whether this pathway underlies the sex-based difference in susceptibility is unknown. Approach and Results: The role of IL-1 signaling was investigated in the <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> cell wall extract-induced experimental mouse model of KD vasculitis. Five-week-old male and female mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>cell wall extract, or a combination of <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>cell wall extract and the IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra. Aortitis, coronary arteritis inflammation score and abdominal aorta dilatation, and aneurysm development were assessed. mRNA-seq (messenger RNA sequencing) analysis was performed on abdominal aorta tissue. Publicly available human transcriptomics data from patients with KD was analyzed to identify sex differences and disease-associated genes. Male mice displayed enhanced aortitis and coronary arteritis as well as increased incidence and severity of abdominal aorta dilatation and aneurysm, recapitulating the increased incidence in males that is observed in human KD. Gene expression data from patients with KD and abdominal aorta tissue of <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>cell wall extract-injected mice showed enhanced <i>Il1b</i> expression and IL-1 signaling genes in males. Although the more severe IL-1β-mediated disease phenotype observed in male mice was ameliorated by Anakinra treatment, the milder disease phenotype in female mice failed to respond.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">IL-1β may play a central role in mediating sex-based differences in KD, with important implications for the use of anti-IL-1β therapies to treat male and female patients with KD.</AbstractText> "

An immune dysregulation syndrome associated with heterozygous germline mutations in CTLA4 was recently reported. Clinical features include recurrent infections, systemic lymphadenopathy, various autoimmune conditions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and autosomal dominant inheritance, characteristic of primary immunodeficient disease (PID). PID symptoms are variable and few patients with sporadic de novo CTLA4 germline mutations have been described. Here, we report the case of a 26-year-old man with an immune dysregulation syndrome and a de novo CTLA4 germline mutation. The patient exhibited several clinical features associated with PID. Next-generation sequencing revealed a CTLA4 germline mutation, c.436G&gt;A; p.G146R, in exon 2 of CTLA4. Sanger sequencing confirmed the patient was the only member of his family with this germline mutation. The patient was diagnosed with an immune dysregulation syndrome associated with de novo germline CTLA4 mutation, complicated by steroid-refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with abatacept, a CTLA4-immunoglobulin fusion molecule, was initiated, resulting in dramatic resolution of the patient's clinical symptoms. As PID with CTLA4 germline mutation is rare and patients may be under-diagnosed, physicians should be aware of the features of PID.</AbstractText> "

We performed single-eye mRNA-sequencing on microglia at different timepoints following a single inflammatory stimulus to characterise their transcriptome during and after resolution of endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU). <b>Experimental Approach:</b><i>Cx3cr1</i><sup> <i>CreER</i> </sup><i>:R26-tdTomato</i> (C57BL/6) male heterozygotes were administered tamoxifen via different regimes at 4-5 weeks of age. Four weeks post-tamoxifen, mice were injected intravitreally with 10 ng lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin induced uveitis, EIU). Six-hundred retinal microglia were obtained by FACS from individual naïve retinas and at 4 h, 18 h, and 2 weeks following EIU induction. Samples were sequenced to a depth of up to 16.7 million reads using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit. The data was analysed using Partek software and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Genes were considered differentially-expressed (DEG) if the FDR step-up <i>p</i>-value was ≤0.05 and the fold-change was ≥±2. <b>Results:</b> Flow cytometric analysis indicates that the <i>Cx3cr1</i><sup> <i>CreER</i> </sup><i>:R26-tdTomato</i> strain is both sensitive (&gt;95% tagging) and specific (&gt;95% specificity) for microglia when tamoxifen is administered topically to the eye for 3 days. During &quot;early&quot; activation, 613 DEGs were identified. In contrast, 537 DEGs were observed during peak cellular infiltrate and none at 2 weeks, compared to baseline controls (1,069 total unique DEGs). Key marker changes were validated by qPCR, flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy. C5AR1 was identified and validated as a robust marker of differentiating microglial subsets during an LPS response. <b>Conclusion:</b> Using EIU to provide a single defined inflammatory stimulus, mRNA-Seq identified acute transcriptional changes in retinal microglia which returned to their original transcriptome after 2 weeks.

The CDR3 of BCRs is the major site of antigen recognition. Therefore, we analyzed the BCR repertoire of patients with SSc. The BCR repertoires in 12 subjects including eight SSc patients and four healthy controls were characterized by high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis were studied. The average CDR3 length in the SSc group was significantly shorter. The SSc patient displayed more diverse BCR. Moreover, SSc patients with mild skin sclerosis, anti-Scl70, interstitial lung disease or female sex were more diversified. B cells from the SSc patients showed a differential V and J gene usage. SSc patients had distinct BCR repertoires.These findings reflected the differences of BCR repertoires between SSc patients and controls. The higher-usage genes for the BCR sequence might be potential biomarkers of B cell-targeted therapies or diagnosis for SSc.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>©2020 Shi et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

IL-17 has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SLE with lupus nephritis (LN). Although some investigations have indicated that γδ T cells are the major producing cells of IL-17 (γδT17 cells), the function of γδT17 cells in SLE with LN has not yet been fully established. In the present study, transcriptome sequencing analysis was performed to identify genes in γδ T cells differentially expressed between SLE patients with LN and healthy subjects. We first showed that IL-17A expression level in SLE patients is higher than in healthy controls, and the most pronounced increase occurred in the SLE patients with LN. The population of γδ T cells was shown to be smaller in SLE patients, but there was no difference between SLE patients and controls with respect to γδT17 cells. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed 28 different genes associated with SLE disease among the γδ T cells from SLE patients with LN. In these genes, CaMK4 was further confirmed to be differently expressed in SLE patients. Finally, CaMK4 inhibitor was shown to inhibit the secretion of IL-17A in γδ T cells from SLE with LN. Our results suggest that CaMK4 may participate in the pathogenic mechanism of SLE with LN induced by γδT17 T cells. This constitutes evidence that CaMK4 inhibitors may serve as effective reagents in the treatment of SLE with LN.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanisms of JD pathogenesis are not fully understood, but it is known that MAP subverts the host immune system by using macrophages as its primary reservoir. MAP infection in macrophages is often studied in healthy cows or experimentally infected calves, but reports on macrophages from naturally infected cows are lacking. In our study, primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from cows diagnosed as positive (+) or negative (-) for JD were challenged <i>in vitro</i> with live MAP. Analysis using next-generation RNA sequencing revealed that macrophages from JD(+) cows did not present a definite pattern of response to MAP infection. Interestingly, a considerable number of genes, up to 1436, were differentially expressed in JD(-) macrophages. The signatures of the infection time course of 1, 4, 8, and 24 h revealed differential expression of <i>ARG2, COL1A1, CCL2, CSF3, IL1A, IL6, IL10, PTGS2, PTX3, SOCS3, TNF</i>, and <i>TNFAIP6</i> among other genes, with major effects on host signaling pathways. While several immune pathways were affected by MAP, other pathways related to hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation, lipid homeostasis, such as LXR/RXR (liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor) activation pathways, and autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis) also responded to the presence of live MAP. Comparison of the profiles of the unchallenged MDMs from JD(+) vs. JD(-) cows showed that 868 genes were differentially expressed, suggesting that these genes were already affected before monocytes differentiated into macrophages. The downregulated genes predominantly modified the general cell metabolism by downregulating amino acid synthesis and affecting cholesterol biosynthesis and other energy production pathways while introducing a pro-fibrotic pattern associated with foam cells. The upregulated genes indicated that lipid homeostasis was already supporting fat storage in uninfected JD(+) MDMs. For JD(+) MDMs, differential gene expression expounds long-term mechanisms established during disease progression of paratuberculosis. Therefore, MAP could further promote disease persistence by influencing long-term macrophage behavior by using both tolerance and fat-storage states. This report contributes to a better understanding of MAP's controls over the immune cell response and mechanisms of MAP survival.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Ariel, Gendron, Dudemaine, Gévry, Ibeagha-Awemu and Bissonnette.</CopyrightInformation> "

Yet, very little is known about how aging and injury interact and contribute to OA pathogenesis. In the present study, we examined age- and injury-related molecular changes in mouse knee joints that could contribute to OA. Using RNA-seq, first we profiled the knee joint transcriptome of 10-week-old, 62-week-old, and 95-week-old mice and found that the expression of several inflammatory-response related genes increased as a result of aging, whereas the expression of several genes involved in cartilage metabolism decreased with age. To determine how aging impacts post-traumatic arthritis (PTOA) development, the right knee joints of 10-week-old and 62-week-old mice were injured using a non-invasive tibial compression injury model and injury-induced structural and molecular changes were assessed. At six-week post-injury, 62-week-old mice displayed significantly more cartilage degeneration and osteophyte formation compared with young mice. Although both age groups elicited similar transcriptional responses to injury, 62-week-old mice had higher activation of inflammatory cytokines than 10-week-old mice, whereas cartilage/bone metabolism genes had higher expression in 10-week-old mice, suggesting that the differential expression of these genes might contribute to the differences in PTOA severity observed between these age groups.</AbstractText> "

In this study, we explored the expression of EZH2, an H3K27me3 transferase, in human OA cartilages and its roles in regulating OA pathogenesis. Here, we found EZH2 was highly expressed in both mice and human OA cartilage samples by using histological analysis and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The medial meniscectomy (MMx) OA model results indicated the conditional knockout of Ezh2 deteriorated OA pathological conditions. Furthermore, we showed the positive role of Ezh2 in cartilage wound healing and inhibition of hypertrophy through activating TNFSF13B, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. Further, we also indicated that the effect of TNFSF13B, increased by Ezh2, might boost the healing of chondrocytes through increasing the phosphorylation of Akt. Taken together, our results uncovered an EZH2-positive subpopulation existed in OA patients, and that EZH2-TNFSF13B signaling was responsible for regulating chondrocyte healing and hypertrophy. Thus, EZH2 might act as a new potential target for OA diagnosis and treatment. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</CopyrightInformation> "

Studies have shown that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) represent one important group of epigenetic regulators. However, the role of individual HDAC members for the pathogenesis of arthritis is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate that mice with a T cell-specific deletion of HDAC1 (HDAC1-cKO) are resistant to the development of Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), whereas the antibody response to collagen type II was undisturbed, indicating an unaltered T cell-mediated B cell activation. The inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-6 were significantly decreased in sera of HDAC1-cKO mice. IL-6 treated HDAC1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed an impaired upregulation of CCR6. Selective inhibition of class I HDACs with the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 under Th17-skewing conditions inhibited the upregulation of chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) in mouse and human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, analysis of human RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data and histological analysis of synovial tissue samples from human RA patients revealed the existence of CD4<sup>+</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup> cells with enhanced HDAC1 expression. Our data indicate a key role for HDAC1 for the pathogenesis of CIA and suggest that HDAC1 and other class I HDACs might be promising targets of selective HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) for the treatment of RA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019.

Expression of several B-cell markers were significantly different in ACPA<sup>+</sup> RA compared to healthy controls, including an increase in HLA-DR across subsets, CD22 in clusters of IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells and CD11c in IgA<sup>+</sup> memory. Moreover, both IgA<sup>+</sup> and IgG<sup>+</sup> double negative (IgD<sup>-</sup> CD27<sup>-</sup>) CD11c<sup>+</sup> B cells were increased in ACPA<sup>+</sup> RA, and there was a trend for elevation in a CXCR5/CCR6<sup>high</sup> transitional B-cell cluster. In the RA BCR repertoire, there were significant differences in subclass distribution and, notably, the frequency of VH with low somatic hypermutation (SHM) was strikingly higher, especially in IgG1 (p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, both ACPA<sup>+</sup> and ACPA<sup>-</sup> RA patients had significantly higher total serum IgA and IgM compared to controls, based on serology of larger cohorts (n = 3494 IgA; n = 397 IgM). The observed elevated Ig-levels, distortion in IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells, increase in double negative B cells, change in B-cell markers, and elevation of unmutated IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells suggests defects in B-cell tolerance in RA.

The most activated upstream regulators included TNF, an important drug target, as well as IFN-gamma and CD40LG, all of which are known to play important pathogenic roles in RA. The differentially expressed genes from synovium included several potential biomarkers, such as CCL5, CCL13, CCL18, CX3CL1, CXCL6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, IL15, IL32, IL1RN, SPP1, and TNFSF11. By contrast, microarray studies of WBC, PBMC and CD4+ T cells showed variable pathways and limited pathway overlap with synovium. Similarly, scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of arthritis did not support that inflammatory responses in peripheral blood reflect those in the arthritic joints. These data showed pathway overlap between mouse joint cells and synovium from patients with RA, but not with cells in peripheral blood.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings indicate a dichotomy between gene expression changes, pathways, upstream regulators and biomarkers in synovium and cell types in peripheral blood, which complicates identification of biomarkers in blood.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Type I IFNs are elevated in nonlesional SLE skin and promote inflammatory responses. Staphylococcus aureus, known to induce IFN production, could play a role in cutaneous inflammation in SLE. We show here that active cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesions are highly colonized (∼50%) by S. aureus. To define the impact of IFNs on S. aureus colonization, we examined the effects of type I and type II IFNs on S. aureus adherence and invasion. An increase in adherent S. aureus was observed after exposure to both IFN-α and -γ, whereas IFN-γ appeared to inhibit invasion of S. aureus. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesional skin microarray data and RNA sequencing data from SLE keratinocytes identified repression of barrier gene expression, such as filaggrin and loricrin, and SLE keratinocytes exhibited increased S. aureus-binding integrins. These SLE-associated changes could be replicated by IFN treatment of keratinocytes. Further, SLE keratinocytes exhibited increased binding to S. aureus. Together, these data suggest that chronic exposure to IFNs induces barrier disruption that allows for higher S. aureus colonization in SLE skin.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The major IRF5-SLE risk haplotype is common across populations, yet immune functions for the risk haplotype are undefined. We characterized the global immune phenotype of healthy donors homozygous for the major risk and nonrisk haplotypes and identified cell lineage-specific alterations that mimic presymptomatic SLE. Contrary to previous studies in B lymphoblastoid cell lines and SLE immune cells, IRF5 genetic variants had little effect on IRF5 protein levels in healthy donors. Instead, we detected basal IRF5 hyperactivation in the myeloid compartment of risk donors that drives the SLE immune phenotype. Risk donors were anti-nuclear antibody positive with anti-Ro and -MPO specificity, had increased circulating plasma cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and had enhanced spontaneous NETosis. The IRF5-SLE immune phenotype was conserved over time and probed mechanistically by ex vivo coculture, indicating that risk neutrophils are drivers of the global immune phenotype. RNA-Seq of risk neutrophils revealed increased IRF5 transcript expression, IFN pathway enrichment, and decreased expression of ROS pathway genes. Altogether, the data support that individuals carrying the IRF5-SLE risk haplotype are more susceptible to environmental/stochastic influences that trigger chronic immune activation, predisposing to the development of clinical SLE.</AbstractText> "

Chronic interferon (IFN) signaling and cytokine dysregulation may identify diseases with available targeted treatments.METHODSSixty-six consecutively referred USAID patients underwent underwent screening for the presence of an interferon signature using a standardized type-I IFN-response-gene score (IRG-S), cytokine profiling, and genetic evaluation by next-generation sequencing.RESULTSThirty-six USAID patients (55%) had elevated IRG-S. Neutrophilic panniculitis (40% vs. 0%), basal ganglia calcifications (46% vs. 0%), interstitial lung disease (47% vs. 5%), and myositis (60% vs. 10%) were more prevalent in patients with elevated IRG-S. Moderate IRG-S elevation and highly elevated serum IL-18 distinguished 8 patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and recurrent macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Among patients with panniculitis and progressive cytopenias, 2 patients were compound heterozygous for potentially novel LRBA mutations, 4 patients harbored potentially novel splice variants in IKBKG (which encodes NF-κB essential modulator [NEMO]), and 6 patients had de novo frameshift mutations in SAMD9L. Of additional 12 patients with elevated IRG-S and CANDLE-, SAVI- or Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-like (AGS-like) phenotypes, 5 patients carried mutations in either SAMHD1, TREX1, PSMB8, or PSMG2. Two patients had anti-MDA5 autoantibody-positive juvenile dermatomyositis, and 7 could not be classified. Patients with LRBA, IKBKG, and SAMD9L mutations showed a pattern of IRG elevation that suggests prominent NF-κB activation different from the canonical interferonopathies CANDLE, SAVI, and AGS.CONCLUSIONSIn patients with elevated IRG-S, we identified characteristic clinical features and 3 additional autoinflammatory diseases: IL-18-mediated PAP and recurrent MAS (IL-18PAP-MAS), NEMO deleted exon 5-autoinflammatory syndrome (NEMO-NDAS), and SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease (SAMD9L-SAAD).

The abundance of gene set analysis methods speaks to their popularity, but raises the question of the extent to which results are affected by the choice of method. Our systematic analysis of 13 popular methods using 6 different datasets, from both DNA microarray and RNA-Seq origin, shows that this choice matters a great deal. We observed that the overall number of gene sets reported by each method differed by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and there was a bias toward reporting large gene sets with some methods. Furthermore, there was substantial disagreement between the 20 most statistically significant gene sets reported by the methods. This was also observed when expanding to the 100 most statistically significant reported gene sets. For different datasets of the same phenotype/condition, the top 20 and top 100 most significant results also showed little to no agreement even when using the same method. GAGE, PAGE, and ORA were the only methods able to achieve relatively high reproducibility when comparing the 20 and 100 most statistically significant gene sets. Biological validation on a juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) dataset showed wide variation in terms of the relevance of the top 20 and top 100 most significant gene sets to known biology of the disease, where GAGE predicted the most relevant gene sets, followed by GSEA, ORA, and PAGE.</AbstractText> "

In silico experiments give insight in the role of each of the pathway components and reveal which perturbations may deregulate the basal healthy state of cells and tissues.

We performed in silico experiments to characterize molecular mechanisms of cell fate decisions. The model was used to mimic biological scenarios during cell differentiation using RNA-sequencing data of a variety of stem cell sources as input. In a case-study, we wet-lab-tested the model-derived hypothesis that expression of DKK1 (Dickkopf-1) and FRZB (Frizzled related protein, WNT antagonists) and GREM1 (gremlin 1, BMP antagonist) prevents IL1β (Interleukin 1 beta)-induced MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) expression, thereby preventing cartilage degeneration, at least in the short term.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and optic neuritis preceded by autoinflammation, triggered by periodic fever syndrome. We report on a case of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with optic neuritis and periodic fever syndrome in a 12-year-old Ecuadorian Hispanic boy with several relapses over the past 10 years, always preceded by autoinflammatory manifestations and without evidence of infectious processes. Whole exome sequencing was performed, and although the results were not conclusive, we found variants in genes associated with both autoinflammatory (NLRP12) and neurological (POLR3A) phenotypes that could be related to the disease pathogenesis having a polygenic rather than monogenic trait.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We propose that an autoinflammatory basis should be pursued in patients diagnosed as having acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and no record of infections.

The disease primarily presents with recurrent infections, and patients may also present with inflammatory conditions, including noninfectious colitis, and an increased frequency of autoimmunity. We report here a patient with CGD in whom the presentation, unlike the classical presentation of CGD, was predominantly of an inflammatory and autoimmune phenotype.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Case presentation"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">A 3-year-old Pakistani female presented with bloody diarrhea since the age of 7 days, followed by the development of perianal abscesses and fistula. There was no other history of recurrent infections. The patient subsequently developed joint pain and stiffness with persistently elevated inflammatory markers and elevated anti-cyclic citrullinate peptide (anti-CCP) antibody titer. She was diagnosed with oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and colitis. The diagnosis of CGD was later made and was based on the absence of NADPH oxidase activity in the patient's neutrophils upon phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation using the dihydrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) flow cytometry test. Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed an unreported deletion mutation in exon 10 as a homozygous loss-of-function variant of the human neutrophil oxidase factor 2 (<i>NCF2</i>) (<i>NCF2</i>: NM_001190789, nucleotide change: c.855_856del:p.T285fs).

We report a case of joint infection caused by <i>Legionella micdadei</i> and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> in a 54-year-old male with medication history of oral steroid for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). He developed arthritis in his right metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints without precursor pneumonia. In the joint aspirate, <i>S. aureus</i> was detected through culture. The existence of <i>L. micdadei</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> were indicated by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and confirmed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. After oral levofloxacin treatment for 54 days, the patient's symptoms ameliorated and blood test results improved, which were consistent with the dynamic trend of reads numbers in mNGS data. Our case included, arthritis caused by <i>Legionella</i> spp. have been reported in 11 patients. However, our case is the first to report septic arthritis caused by <i>L. micdadei</i> in native joints and monitored by mNGS. This case demonstrated an application of mNGS for etiological diagnosis and semi-quantification in joint aspirate. mNGS may serve as a promising tool for rapid and accurate etiological diagnosis and surveillance, contributing to appropriate antimicrobial drug applications and timely medication adjustments when necessary.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

"177";"31803699";"Giant Cell Tumor of Tendon Sheath and Tendinopathy as Early Features of Early Onset Sarcoidosis.";" <AbstractText>Giant cell tumor of tendon sheath (GCTTS) is characterized by diffuse proliferation of synovial-like cells and multinucleated giant cells along tendon sheaths. This benign tumor typically presents in the third to fourth decade of life and is exceeding rare in children. Here we describe a case of a 10-years-old girl with a history of soft tissue swelling involving the third digit of left hand, bilateral wrists and ankles. Pathology of the finger mass revealed abundant multinucleated giant cells consistent with GCTTS. Resection of the tendinous masses from the ankles also showed multinucleated giant cells along with chronic bursitis. She began to show features of polyarticular arthritis by age 7. Due to progression of arthritis, whole exome sequencing was performed and found a <i>de novo</i> heterozygous mutation in <i>NOD2</i> (p. R334Q). This variant is the most common mutation responsible for early onset sarcoidosis (EOS)/Blau syndrome, an autoinflammatory disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation of joints, skin and eyes. The early onset of symptoms and presence of multinucleated giant cells and granuloma in this case are in keeping with a diagnosis of EOS/Blau syndrome. The patient responded well to treatment with methotrexate and etanercept. This case extends the clinical spectrum of EOS/Blau syndrome, which should be considered for GCTTS and other unusual presentations of tendon inflammation in children, even in the absence of the characteristic triad of arthritis, dermatitis and uveitis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Zheng, Lee, Huang, Wang and Li.</CopyrightInformation> "

"181";"31779271";"Synovial-Fluid miRNA Signature for Diagnosis of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.";" <AbstractText>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common chronic inflammatory rheumatism in childhood; microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as diagnostic biomarkers. Although joints are the primary targets for JIA, a synovial fluid-based miRNA signature has never been studied. We aim to identify miRNA biomarkers in JIA by comparing synovial fluid and serum samples from children with JIA and <i>K.</i><i>kingae</i> septic arthritis (SA). With next-generation high-throughput sequencing, we measured the absolute levels of 2083 miRNAs in synovial fluid and serum from an exploratory cohort of children and validated differentially expressed miRNAs in a replication study by using RT-qPCR. We identified a 19-miRNA signature only in synovial fluid samples that was significantly deregulated, with at least 2-fold change in expression, in JIA versus SA (p &lt; 0.01). The combination of miR-6764-5p, miR-155, and miR-146a-5p expression in synovial fluid yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 1 (95% CI 0.978 to 1), thereby perfectly differentiating JIA from SA in children. We propose, for the first time, a synovial fluid-specific miRNA signature for JIA and associated signaling pathways that may indicate potential biomarkers to assist in the classification and differential diagnosis of JIA and help in understanding JIA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> "

Immunohistochemical staining of immune cell markers correlated with the gene expression-based immune cell signatures. The prevalence of immune cell signatures in early diffuse SSc patients was higher than in patients with longer disease duration. In the multivariable model, adaptive immune cell signatures were significantly associated with shorter disease duration, while fibroblast and macrophage cell type signatures were associated with higher modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS).

"183";"31762409";"RTD-1 therapeutically normalizes synovial gene signatures in rat autoimmune arthritis and suppresses proinflammatory mediators in RA synovial fibroblasts.";" <AbstractText>Rhesus theta defensin-1 (RTD-1), a macrocyclic immunomodulatory host defense peptide from Old World monkeys, is therapeutic in pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats, a model of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) analysis was used to interrogate the changes in gene expression in PIA rats, which identified 617 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PIA synovial tissue of diseased rats. Upstream regulator analysis showed upregulation of gene expression pathways regulated by TNF, IL1B, IL6, proinflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) involved in RA. In contrast, ligand-dependent nuclear receptors like the liver X-receptors NR1H2 and NR1H3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) were downregulated in arthritic synovia. Daily RTD-1 treatment of PIA rats for 1-5 days following disease presentation modulated 340 of the 617 disease genes, and synovial gene expression in PIA rats treated 5 days with RTD-1 closely resembled the gene signature of naive synovium. Systemic RTD-1 inhibited proinflammatory upstream regulators such as TNF, IL1, and IL6 and activated antiarthritic ligand-dependent nuclear receptor pathways, including PPARG, NR1H2, and NR1H3, that were suppressed in untreated PIA rats. RTD-1 also inhibited proinflammatory responses in IL-1β-stimulated human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in vitro and diminished expression of human orthologs of disease genes that are induced in rat PIA synovium. Thus, the antiarthritic mechanisms of systemic RTD-1 include homeostatic regulation of arthritogenic gene networks in a manner that correlates temporally with clinical resolution of rat PIA.</AbstractText> "
"184";"31754732";"Transcriptomic characterization of culture-associated changes in murine and human precision-cut tissue slices.";" <AbstractText>Our knowledge of complex pathological mechanisms underlying organ fibrosis is predominantly derived from animal studies. However, relevance of animal models for human disease is limited; therefore, an ex vivo model of human precision-cut tissue slices (PCTS) might become an indispensable tool in fibrosis research and drug development by bridging the animal-human translational gap. This study, presented as two parts, provides comprehensive characterization of the dynamic transcriptional changes in PCTS during culture by RNA sequencing. Part I investigates the differences in culture-induced responses in murine and human PCTS derived from healthy liver, kidney and gut. Part II delineates the molecular processes in cultured human PCTS generated from diseased liver, kidney and ileum. We demonstrated that culture was associated with extensive transcriptional changes and impacted PCTS in a universal way across the organs and two species by triggering an inflammatory response and fibrosis-related extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. All PCTS shared mRNA upregulation of IL-11 and ECM-degrading enzymes MMP3 and MMP10. Slice preparation and culturing activated numerous pathways across all PCTS, especially those involved in inflammation (IL-6, IL-8 and HMGB1 signalling) and tissue remodelling (osteoarthritis pathway and integrin signalling). Despite the converging effects of culture, PCTS display species-, organ- and pathology-specific differences in the regulation of genes and canonical pathways. The underlying pathology in human diseased PCTS endures and influences biological processes like cytokine release. Our study reinforces the use of PCTS as an ex vivo fibrosis model and supports future studies towards its validation as a preclinical tool for drug development.</AbstractText> "

SLE is characterized by elevated levels of a pathogenic neutrophil subset known as low-density granulocytes (LDGs). The origin and phenotypic, functional, and pathogenic heterogeneity of LDGs remain to be systematically determined. Transcriptomics and epigenetic assessment of lupus LDGs, autologous normal-density neutrophils, and healthy control neutrophils was performed by bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing. Functional readouts were compared among neutrophil subsets. SLE LDGs display significant transcriptional and epigenetic heterogeneity and comprise 2 subpopulations of intermediate-mature and immature neutrophils, with different degrees of chromatin accessibility and differences in transcription factor motif analysis. Differences in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, oxidized mitochondrial DNA release, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, ability to harm the endothelium, and responses to type I interferon (IFN) stimulation are evident among LDG subsets. Compared with other immune cell subsets, LDGs display the highest expression of IFN-inducible genes. Distinct LDG subsets correlate with specific clinical features of lupus and with the presence and severity of coronary artery disease. Phenotypic, functional, and pathogenic neutrophil heterogeneity are prevalent in SLE and may promote immune dysregulation and prominent vascular damage characteristic of this disease.</AbstractText> "

The molecular pathways by which B cells become pathogenic PC secreting autoantibodies in SLE are incompletely characterized. Histone deactylase 6 (HDAC6) is a unique cytoplasmic HDAC that modifies the interaction of a number of tubulin- associated proteins; inhibition of HDAC6 has been shown to be beneficial in murine models of SLE, but the downstream pathways accounting for the therapeutic benefit have not been clearly delineated. In the current study, we sought to determine whether selective HDAC6 inhibition would abrogate abnormal B cell activation in SLE. We treated NZB/W lupus mice with the selective HDAC6 inhibitor, ACY-738, for 4 weeks beginning at 20 weeks-of age. After only 4 weeks of treatment, manifestation of lupus nephritis (LN) were greatly reduced in these animals. We then used RNAseq to determine the genomic signatures of splenocytes from treated and untreated mice and applied computational cellular and pathway analysis to reveal multiple signaling events associated with B cell activation and differentiation in SLE that were modulated by HDAC6 inhibition. PC development was abrogated and germinal center (GC) formation was greatly reduced. When the HDAC6 inhibitor-treated lupus mouse gene signatures were compared to human lupus patient gene signatures, the results showed numerous immune, and inflammatory pathways increased in active human lupus were significantly decreased in the HDAC6 inhibitor treated animals. Pathway analysis suggested alterations in cellular metabolism might contribute to the normalization of lupus mouse spleen genomic signatures, and this was confirmed by direct measurement of the impact of the HDAC6 inhibitor on metabolic activities of murine spleen cells. Taken together, these studies show HDAC6 inhibition decreases B cell activation signaling pathways and reduces PC differentiation in SLE and suggest that a critical event might be modulation of cellular metabolism.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ren, Catalina, Eden, Liao, Read, Luo, McMillan, Hulver, Jarpe, Bachali, Grammer, Lipsky and Reilly.</CopyrightInformation> "

Performance was better in the whole dataset model. We note a high degree of overlap between genes identified in both populations. Using ingenuity pathway analysis, genes from the whole dataset associated with cell-to-cell signaling and interactions, cell morphology, organismal injury and abnormalities, and protein synthesis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study demonstrates it is feasible to use machine learning in conjunction with RNA sequencing of PBMCs to predict JIA stage.

Cells were phenotypically, transcriptionally, and functionally analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 6-18), T cell receptor β (TCRβ) sequencing (n = 3), RNA-Seq (n = 3), quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (n = 4), and Luminex or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n = 4-16).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">IL-17A+CD8+ T cells were predominantly TCRαβ+ and their frequencies were increased in the SF versus the PB of patients with established PsA (P &lt; 0.0001) or other SpA (P = 0.0009). TCRβ sequencing showed that these cells were polyclonal in PsA (median clonality 0.08), while RNA-Seq and deep immunophenotyping revealed that PsA synovial Tc17 cells had hallmarks of Th17 cells (RORC/IL23R/CCR6/CD161) and Tc1 cells (granzyme A/B). Synovial Tc17 cells showed a strong tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cell signature and secreted a range of proinflammatory cytokines. We identified CXCR6 as a marker for synovial Tc17 cells, and increased levels of CXCR6 ligand CXCL16 in PsA SF (P = 0.0005), which may contribute to their retention in the joint.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our results identify synovial Tc17 cells as a polyclonal subset of Trm cells characterized by polyfunctional, proinflammatory mediator production and CXCR6 expression. The molecular signature and functional profiling of these cells may help explain how Tc17 cells can contribute to synovial inflammation and disease persistence in PsA and possibly other types of SpA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, The Authors.

Gait behaviours of the mice were monitored at different ages. Spontaneous synovial joint destruction was evaluated by digital radiographic imaging and μCT analysis; changes of articular cartilage and synovitis were determined by histological analysis. The recruitment of macrophages in the synovium was examined by immunostaining and monocyte trafficking assay. RNA-seq analysis, Western blotting and chemotaxis experiment were performed on control and FGFR3-deficient macrophages. The peripheral blood from non-osteoarthritis (OA) donors and patients with OA were analysed. Mice were treated with neutralising antibody against CXCR7 to investigate the role of CXCR7 in arthritis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">R3cKO mice but not control mice developed spontaneous cartilage destruction in multiple synovial joints at the age of 13 months. Moreover, the synovitis and macrophage accumulation were observed in the joints of 9-month-old R3cKO mice when the articular cartilage was not grossly destructed. FGFR3 deficiency in myeloid cells also aggravated joint destruction in DMM mouse model. Mechanically, FGFR3 deficiency promoted macrophage chemotaxis partly through activation of NF-κB/CXCR7 pathway. Inhibition of CXCR7 could significantly reverse FGFR3-deficiency-enhanced macrophage chemotaxis and the arthritic phenotype in R3cKO mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study identifies the role of FGFR3 in synovial macrophage recruitment and synovitis, which provides a new insight into the pathological mechanisms of inflammation-related arthritis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

A total of 138 RA patients and 21 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. Fecal samples were collected for bacterial DNA extraction and 16S ribosome (r)RNA sequencing, followed by analyses of gut microbiota composition. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-17A were determined by using ELISA. Our results indicated that RA patients had lower diversity index, which reflects both evenness and richness of gut microbiota, compared to HC. The alpha-diversity was lower in anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA)-positive patients than in HC. The phylum <i>Verrucomicrobiae</i> and genus <i>Akkermansia</i> were more abundant in patients compared to HC. There was increased relative abundance of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> as well as <i>Klebsiella</i>, and less abundance of <i>Bifidobacterium</i> in patients with high levels of TNF-α or IL-17A compared to those who had low levels of these cytokines. In addition, ACPA-positive patients had higher proportions of <i>Blautia</i>, <i>Akkermansia</i>, and <i>Clostridiales</i> than ACPA-negative patients. Gut dysbiosis in RA patients was presented as different microbial composition and its association with inflammatory parameters as well as ACPA seropositivity. These findings support the involvement of gut microbiota in RA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> "

Increasing evidence suggests that both genetic susceptibilities and changes in DNA methylation influence pivotal biological pathways and thereby contribute to the disease. The role of DNA methylation in SSc has not been fully elucidated, because existing investigations of DNA methylation predominantly focused on nucleotide CpGs within restricted genic regions, and were performed on samples containing mixed cell types.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on purified CD4+ T lymphocytes from nine SSc patients and nine controls in a pilot study, and then profiled genome-wide cytosine methylation as well as genetic variations. We adopted robust statistical methods to identify differentially methylated genomic regions (DMRs). We then examined pathway enrichment associated with genes located in these DMRs. We also tested whether changes in CpG methylation were associated with adjacent genetic variation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We profiled DNA methylation at more than three million CpG dinucleotides genome-wide. We identified 599 DMRs associated with 340 genes, among which 54 genes exhibited further associations with adjacent genetic variation. We also found these genes were associated with pathways and functions that are known to be abnormal in SSc, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, skin lesion formation and progression, and angiogenesis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The CD4+ T cell DNA cytosine methylation landscape in SSc involves crucial genes in disease pathogenesis. Some of the methylation patterns are also associated with genetic variation. These findings provide essential foundations for future studies of epigenetic regulation and genome-epigenome interaction in SSc.</AbstractText> "

Response to treatment was categorized by EULAR criteria. A cell type-specific data analysis was conducted to evaluate the involvement of the most common immune cell sub-populations. Findings concordant between the two cohorts were further assessed for reproducibility using selected NCBI-GEO datasets and clinical laboratory measurements available in the CERTAIN database.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A treatment-related signature suggesting a reduction in neutrophils, independent of the status of response, was indicated by a high level of correlation (ρ = 0.62; p &lt; 0.01) between the two cohorts. A baseline, response signature of increased innate cell types in responders compared to increased adaptive cell types in non-responders was identified in both cohorts. This result was further assessed by applying the cell type-specific analysis to five other publicly available RA datasets. Evaluation of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio at baseline in the remaining patients (n = 1962) from the CERTAIN database confirmed the observation (odds ratio of good/moderate response = 1.20 [95% CI = 1.03-1.41, p = 0.02]).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Differences in innate/adaptive immune cell type composition at baseline may be a major contributor to response to anti-TNF treatment within the first 3 months of therapy.</AbstractText> "

"200";"31616519";"Increased expression of hub gene CXCL10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.";" <AbstractText>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypical autoimmune disease, characterized by overactive inflammation and aberrant activation of lymphocytes. Chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10) has an important role in the initiation and deterioration of SLE. However, the expression levels of CXCL10 mRNA in T-helper (Th) cells and B lymphocytes from SLE patients have remained elusive. In the present study, a Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed gene (DEG) profiles obtained from RNA sequencing data for three matched samples was performed to explore the hub genes, mainly through Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and protein-protein interaction analysis. Furthermore, the expression of CXCL10 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells and CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells of 108 subjects, including 66 SLE patients and 42 healthy controls, was confirmed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. In addition, 4 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in the 3'-untranslated region of CXCL10 were assessed using the Snapshot SNP genotyping assay. A total of 152 clustered DEGs mainly accumulated in immune-associated GO terms and interferon-associated pathways were identified. The expression of CXCL10, one of the central genes in the interaction network cluster (the degree of interaction, MCODE score=28.414), was 6.27-fold higher in SLE patients compared with control patients. Furthermore, CXCL10 mRNA was confirmed to be elevated in PBMCs and CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells of patients with SLE (P&lt;0.001 for the two cell types). However, no significant difference in CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes was present (P=0.881). In addition, no polymorphism was identified in four selected loci from the samples. Taken together, the present results demonstrated that CXCL10, one of the hub genes in the pathogenesis of SLE, is upregulated in PBMCs and B lymphocytes of patients with SLE, although none of the SNPs selected for analysis in the present study were identified to have any potential associations with SLE.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright: © Zhang et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

However, the role of circRNAs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> We initially used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to comprehensively analyze circRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 SLE patients, stratified by their disease activity characteristics (stable or active SLE), and 10 healthy controls (HCs). Candidate circRNAs identified were first validated by quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR in PBMC samples from a training-phase cohort of five SLE patients and five HCs. The significantly dysregulated circRNAs were then confirmed by qRT-PCR in a validation cohort of 23 SLE patients and 21 HCs, and in an external validation cohort with 64 SLE patients, 58 HCs, and 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, we conducted bioinformatics analysis and western blotting investigating the relationships between the candidate circRNAs and SLE progression. <b>Results:</b> Multilayer integrative analysis of circRNA regulation showed that 84 circRNAs were upregulated and 30 were downregulated in patients with SLE compared with HCs. We then analyzed the intersection of these differentially expressed circRNAs in an SLE-stable cohort, an SLE-active cohort, and HCs. This enabled us to narrow down dysregulated circRNAs to 15 upregulated circRNAs. Only hsa_circ_0000479 was significantly upregulated in PBMCs of patients with SLE compared with HCs (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the diagnostic potential of hsa_circ_0000479 expression to distinguish SLE patients from HCs and RA patients was also significantly increased in the validation-phase and external-validation-phase cohorts (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). When distinguishing SLE patients from HCs, the diagnostic specificities of hsa_circ_0000479 were 0.619 and 1.0 in two validation cohorts, respectively (AUCs = 0.731 and 0.730, respectively). It was also significantly increased in either stable SLE patients or active SLE patients compared with HCs in these two cohorts (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). We also used bioinformatics analysis to show that hsa_circ_0000479 regulates SLE progression by modulating metabolic pathways and the Wnt signaling pathway. Western blotting revealed that the expression of Wnt-16 protein was significantly decreased in SLE. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that hsa_circ_0000479 has potential as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of SLE.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Guo, Wang, Ye, Shi, Yan, Lin, Huang, Li, Lin, Zhu, Xue and Zhang.</CopyrightInformation> "

Given the absence of clinical trials until now, no standard treatment strategy exists for DADA2. Currently, anti-TNF alpha agents are the mainstay of treatment, based on the data both from the initial two reports and from subsequent studies.

Two studies have revealed the aberrant circRNA expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by microarrays. However, due to the intrinsic defects of microarrays, such as their inability to detect unidentified circRNAs, we examined the circRNA expression profiles in the PBMCs from four RA patients and three healthy controls by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and further explored the value of circRNAs in diagnosing RA. The results showed 71 markedly dysregulated circRNAs, including 41 upregulated and 30 downregulated circRNAs; these data included several previously unidentified candidate circRNAs. Gene Ontology and pathway annotation revealed that the most altered pathways and genes were associated with inflammation and transcriptional activity, such as the TNF pathway. The selected dysregulated circRNAs were verified by qRT-PCR in the PBMCs of 32 RA patients and 20 healthy controls, and the results indicated that hsa_circ_0000396 and hsa_circ_0130438 were downregulated in the RA group versus the healthy group, consistent with the RNA-seq data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated the diagnostic value of both circRNAs for RA. Our results identified aberrant dysregulated circRNAs in RA patients, including several identified circRNAs, and the diagnostic value of circRNAs for RA, suggesting the superiority of RNA-seq versus microarrays for screening differentially expressed circRNAs and further strengthening the potential diagnostic value of circRNAs for the diagnosis of RA.</AbstractText> "

The predominant pathology (23 of 36) was pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and/or endogenous lipoid pneumonia (PAP/ELP), with atypical features including regional involvement and concomitant vascular changes. Apparent severe delayed drug hypersensitivity occurred in some cases. The 5-year survival was 42%. Whole exome sequencing (20 of 61) did not identify a novel monogenic defect or likely causal PAP-related or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)-related mutations. Trisomy 21 and young sJIA onset increased LD risk. Exposure to IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors (46 of 61) was associated with multiple LD features.

RNA-seq was performed on laser-micro-dissected RNA from cartilage of +/+ and c/c DMM-operated mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In situ hybridisation demonstrated a correlation between the upregulation of ER stress marker, BiP, and early signs of proteoglycan loss and cartilage damage in DMM-operated +/+ mice. Histological analysis revealed a significant reduction in OA severity in c/c mice compared with +/+ at 2 weeks post-DMM. This chondroprotective effect in c/c mice was associated with a higher ambient level of BiP protein prior to DMM and a delay in chondrocyte apoptosis. RNA-seq analysis suggested Xbp1-regulated networks to be significantly enriched in c/c mice at 2 weeks post-DMM. Compromising the ER through genetically ablating Atf6α, a key ER stress sensor, had no effect on DMM-induced OA severity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our studies indicate that an increased capacity to effectively manage increases in ER stress in articular cartilage due either to pre-conditioning as a result of prior exposure to ER stress or to genetic pre-disposition may be beneficial in delaying the onset of OA, but once established, ER stress plays no significant role in disease progression.</AbstractText> "

However, their role in the pathogenesis of arthritis and treatment response to DMARDs in PsA remains uncertain. Therefore, we investigated the IL-36 axis in the synovium of early, treatment-naïve PsA, and for comparison RA patients, pre- and post-DMARDs therapy.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Synovial tissues were collected by US-guided biopsy from patients with early, treatment-naïve PsA and RA at baseline and 6 months after DMARDs therapy. IL-36 family members were investigated in synovium by RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry, and expression levels correlated with DMARDs treatment response ex vivo. Additionally, DMARDs effects on IL-36 were investigated in vitro in fibroblast-like synoviocytes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">PsA synovium displayed a reduced expression of IL-36 antagonists, while IL-36 agonists were comparable between PsA and RA. Additionally, neutrophil-related molecules, which drive a higher activation of the IL-36 pathway, were upregulated in PsA compared with RA. At baseline, the synovial expression of IL-36α was significantly higher in PsA non-responders to DMARDs treatment, with the differential expression being sustained at 6 months post-treatment. In vitro, primary PsA-derived fibroblasts were more responsive to IL-36 stimulation compared with RA and, importantly, DMARDs treatment increased IL-36 expression in PsA fibroblasts.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The impaired balance between IL-36 agonists-antagonists described herein for the first time in PsA synovium and the decreased sensitivity to DMARDs in vitro may explain the apparent lower efficacy of DMARDs in PsA compared with RA. Exogenous replacement of IL-36 antagonists may be a novel promising therapeutic target for PsA patients.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.

An incomplete understanding of the developmental stages of AC has contributed to limited success in this endeavor. Using next generation RNA sequencing, we have transcriptionally characterized two critical stages of AC development in humans-that is, immature neonatal and mature adult, as well as tissue-engineered cartilage derived from culture expanded human mesenchymal stem cells. We identified key transcription factors (TFs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as candidate drivers of the distinct phenotypes of these tissues. AGTR2, SCGB3A1, TFCP2L1, RORC, and TBX4 stand out as key TFs, whose expression may be capable of reprogramming engineered cartilage into a more expandable and neonatal-like cartilage primed for maturation into biomechanically competent cartilage. We also identified that the transcriptional profiles of many annotated but poorly studied lncRNAs were dramatically different between these cartilages, indicating that lncRNAs may also be playing significant roles in cartilage biology. Key neonatal-specific lncRNAs identified include AC092818.1, AC099560.1, and KC877982. Collectively, our results suggest that tissue-engineered cartilage can be optimized for future clinical applications by the specific expression of TFs and lncRNAs.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</CopyrightInformation> "
"213";"31502171";"Microbiome as an Immunological Modifier.";" <AbstractText>Humans are living ecosystems composed of human cells and microbes. The microbiome is the collection of microbes (microbiota) and their genes. Recent breakthroughs in the high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible for us to understand the composition of the human microbiome. Launched by the National Institutes of Health in USA, the human microbiome project indicated that our bodies harbor a wide array of microbes, specific to each body site with interpersonal and intrapersonal variabilities. Numerous studies have indicated that several factors influence the development of the microbiome including genetics, diet, use of antibiotics, and lifestyle, among others. The microbiome and its mediators are in a continuous cross talk with the host immune system; hence, any imbalance on one side is reflected on the other. Dysbiosis (microbiota imbalance) was shown in many diseases and pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and cancer. The microbial composition mirrors inflammation variations in certain disease conditions, within various stages of the same disease; hence, it has the potential to be used as a biomarker.</AbstractText> "

Control shRNA plasmids and lnc-ITSN1-2 shRNA plasmids were transfected into RA FLS, and then cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines expressions were evaluated. Subsequently, mRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were conducted, and rescue experiment of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) mRNA overexpression on alleviating the functions of lnc-ITSN1-2 was performed. Additionally, lnc-ITSN1-2 and NOD2 mRNA expressions in synovial tissue in 30 RA patients and 15 controls were measured. Lnc-ITSN1-2 expression was increased in RA FLS compared with normal FLS. Lnc-ITSN1-2 knockdown inhibited RA FLS proliferation and inflammation while promoted RA FLS apoptosis. mRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses revealed 144 upregulated and 98 downregulated genes by lnc-ITSN1-2 knockdown, which were enriched in regulating inflammatory responses and cytokines related pathways. NOD2 was selected for rescue experiment, which disclosed that upregulating NOD2 alleviated the effect of lnc-ITSN1-2 knockdown on cell proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation in RA FLS. In addition, synovial tissue lnc-ITSN1-2 positively associated with NOD2 mRNA, and both of them positively correlated with disease risk, inflammation and activity of RA. Downregulation of lnc-ITSN1-2 correlates with decreased disease risk and activity of RA, and reduces RA FLS proliferation and inflammation via regulating NOD2/RIP2 signaling pathway.</AbstractText> "

"216";"31469468";"Detection of CSF1 rearrangements deleting the 3' UTR in tenosynovial giant cell tumors.";" <AbstractText>Tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCTs) are characterized by rearrangements of CSF1, thought to drive overexpression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1), thereby promoting tumor growth and recruitment of non-neoplastic mononuclear and multinucleated inflammatory cells. While fusions to collagen promoters have been described, the mechanism of CSF1 overexpression has been unclear in a majority of cases. Two cohorts of TGCT were investigated for CSF1 rearrangements using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and either RNA-seq or DNA-seq with Sanger validation. The study comprised 39 patients, including 13 localized TGCT, 21 diffuse TGCT, and five of unspecified type. CSF1 rearrangements were identified by FISH in 30 cases: 13 translocations, 17 3' deletions. Sequencing confirmed CSF1 breakpoints in 28 cases; in all 28 the breakpoint was found to be downstream of exon 5, replacing or deleting a long 3' UTR containing known miRNA and AU-rich element negative regulatory sequences. We also confirmed the presence of CBL exon 8-9 mutations in six of 21 cases. In conclusion, TGCT in our large cohort were characterized by variable alterations, all of which led to truncation of the 3' end of CSF1, instead of the COL6A3-CSF1 fusions previously reported in some TGCTs. The diversity of fusion partners but consistent integrity of CSF1 functional domains encoded by exons 1-5 support a hypothesis that CSF1 overexpression results from transcription of a truncated form of CSF1 lacking 3' negative regulatory sequences. The presence of CBL mutations affecting the linker and RING finger domain suggests an alternative mechanism for increased CSF1/CSF1R signaling in some cases.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

Herein, we report a comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis of the molecular pathways that drive early RA progression in the disease tissue (synovium), comparing matched peripheral blood RNA-seq in a large cohort of early treatment-naive patients, namely, the Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort (PEAC). We developed a data exploration website (https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/) to dissect gene signatures across synovial and blood compartments, integrated with deep phenotypic profiling. We identified transcriptional subgroups in synovium linked to three distinct pathotypes: fibroblastic pauci-immune pathotype, macrophage-rich diffuse-myeloid pathotype, and a lympho-myeloid pathotype characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. This is suggestive of divergent pathogenic pathways or activation disease states. Pro-myeloid inflammatory synovial gene signatures correlated with clinical response to initial drug therapy, whereas plasma cell genes identified a poor prognosis subgroup with progressive structural damage.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Infectious diseases were excluded. The genetic study for Familial Mediterranean Fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, Mevalonate kinase deficiency, showed the homozygous mutation p.M680I of exon 10 in MEFV. Their parents were heterozygous for the same mutation p.M680I, however, the mother showed severe symptoms of FMF (recurrent attacks of fever, arthralgia and arthritis, abdominal pain, thoracic pain), the father showed recurrent pustulosis prevalent on the hands and limbs, with arthralgia and abdominal pain. Both the patients started colchicine, with an improvement in clinical manifestations and a reduction of serum amyloid A. For the atypical dermatologic signs present in the two siblings and in the father, the study of other autoinflammatory syndromes was performed with next generation sequencing and showed the heterozygous rare missense mutation of unknown significance: p.(Val408Ile) of PSTPIP1 gene in the two siblings and in the mother, the father was negative.

Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed distinct methylation signatures in RA with methylation aberrations noted across chromosomes. Methylation alterations varied with CpG features and genic characteristics. Typically, CpG islands and CpG shores were hypermethylated and displayed the greatest methylation variance. Promoters were hypermethylated and enhancers/gene bodies were hypomethylated, with methylation variance associated with expression variance. RA genetically associated genes preferentially displayed differential methylation and differential expression or interacted with differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes. These differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes were enriched with several signaling pathways and disease categories. 10 genes (<i>CD86, RAB20, XAF1</i>, <i>FOLR3, LTBR</i>, <i>KCNH8</i>, <i>DOK7, PDGFA, PITPNM2, CELSR1</i>) with concomitantly differential methylation in enhancers/promoters/gene bodies and differential expression in B cells were validated.

The functional states of synovial fibroblasts are heterogeneous, and the detailed transition process of their functional states is still unclear.

Our findings revealed that the expression levels of both Circ_0136474 and MMP-13 in OA cartilage tissue were significantly higher than that in normal cartilage tissue. Circ_0136474 could suppress cell proliferation by facilitating MMP-13 expression and suppressing miR-127-5p expression in OA.

The binding sites of miRNAs and target genes were predicted by miRDB, and the targeting relationship between them was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Arthritis in mice with CIA was reduced by moxibustion therapy, and Treg/Th17 cell imbalance was regulated. Seventeen upregulated and twenty-three downregulated miRNAs were identified in moxibustion-treated mice. Seven upregulated miRNAs, seven downregulated miRNAs, and five Treg/Th17 cell differentiation-associated target genes were predicted. Among them, miR-144-3p and <i>Hif1a</i> were suggested to be the keynote miRNA and target gene, respectively, regulating the Treg/Th17 cell differentiation. In conclusions, moxibustion therapy plays a possible regulatory function in rebalancing Treg/Th17 cells by regulating miR-144-3p and its target gene <i>Hif1a</i> to treat CIA.</AbstractText> "

Diversified manifestation and inadequate understanding of etiology has limited its diagnosis and treatment. The co-occurrence of other immune-mediated diseases strongly suggests an involvement of autoimmunity in SAPHO syndrome. However, the role of the largest population of circulating immune cells, neutrophils, is still not well explored. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing to profile the mRNA expression of neutrophils purified from peripheral blood of SAPHO patients to identify key genes associated with SAPHO syndrome, trying to find new functional molecules or biomarkers for this rare disease.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 442 differentially expressed genes were identified (p &lt; 0.05, fold change &gt; 2), in which 294 genes were upregulated and 148 genes were downregulated. Five differentially expressed genes of interest were verified by quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), among which S100A12 was upregulated and positively related to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), while the downregulated gene MYADM was positively related to osteocalcin. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in &quot;systemic lupus erythematosus&quot; and &quot;ECM-receptor interaction&quot;. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment showed that differentially expressed genes may participate in biological processes such as &quot;cell migration&quot; and &quot;cell adhesion&quot;.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In conclusion, this study provides a first insight into transcriptome characteristics of SAPHO syndrome, indicating an over-active neutrophil recruitment in patients and possibly suggesting molecular candidates for further study on diagnosis and pathology of this disease.</AbstractText> "

However, both the exact origin and the role of macrophages in inflammatory joint disease remain unclear. Here we use fate-mapping approaches in conjunction with three-dimensional light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and single-cell RNA sequencing to perform a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of the composition, origin and differentiation of subsets of macrophages within healthy and inflamed joints, and study the roles of these macrophages during arthritis. We find that dynamic membrane-like structures, consisting of a distinct population of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident macrophages, form an internal immunological barrier at the synovial lining and physically seclude the joint. These barrier-forming macrophages display features that are otherwise typical of epithelial cells, and maintain their numbers through a pool of locally proliferating CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>-</sup> mononuclear cells that are embedded into the synovial tissue. Unlike recruited monocyte-derived macrophages, which actively contribute to joint inflammation, these epithelial-like CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> lining macrophages restrict the inflammatory reaction by providing a tight-junction-mediated shield for intra-articular structures. Our data reveal an unexpected functional diversification among synovial macrophages and have important implications for the general role of macrophages in health and disease.</AbstractText> "

Little is known about the pathophysiology of DAH, and no targeted therapy is currently available. Pristane treatment in mice induces systemic autoimmunity and lung hemorrhage that recapitulates hallmark pathologic features of human DAH. Using this experimental model, we performed high-dimensional analysis of lung immune cells in DAH by mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. We found a large influx of myeloid cells to the lungs in DAH and defined the gene expression profile of infiltrating monocytes. Bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes actively migrated to the lungs and homed adjacent to blood vessels. Using 3 models of monocyte deficiency and complementary transfer studies, we established a central role of inflammatory monocytes in the development of DAH. We further found that the myeloid transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 is essential to the development of both DAH and type I interferon-dependent autoimmunity. These findings collectively reveal monocytes as a potential treatment target in DAH.</AbstractText> "

Type I IFNs have been thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of SLE. This study was undertaken to examine an unexpected influence of monocyte/macrophages on the IFN signature.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Proinflammatory (classic) and antiinflammatory (nonclassic) monocyte/macrophages were sorted from mice and analyzed by RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Type I IFN-α/β/ω receptor (IFNAR-1) expression was determined by qPCR and flow cytometry. Macrophages were stimulated in vitro with IFNα, and pSTAT1was measured.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Transcriptional profiling of peritoneal macrophages from mice with pristane-induced SLE unexpectedly indicated a strong IFN signature in classic, but not nonclassic, monocyte/macrophages exposed to the same type I IFN concentrations. Ifnar1 messenger RNA and IFNAR surface staining were higher in classic monocyte/macrophages versus nonclassic monocyte/macrophages (P &lt; 0.0001 and P &lt; 0.05, respectively, by Student's t-test). Nonclassic monocyte/macrophages were also relatively insensitive to IFNα-driven STAT1 phosphorylation. Humans exhibited a similar pattern: higher IFNAR expression (P &lt; 0.0001 by Student's t-test) and IFNα-stimulated gene expression (P &lt; 0.01 by paired Wilcoxon's rank sum test) in classic monocyte/macrophages and lower levels in nonclassic monocyte/macrophages.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This study revealed that the relative abundance of different monocyte/macrophage subsets helps determine the magnitude of the IFN signature. Responsiveness to IFNα signaling reflects differences in IFNAR expression in classic (high IFNAR) compared to nonclassic (low IFNAR) monocyte/macrophages. Thus, the IFN signature depends on both type I IFN production and the responsiveness of monocyte/macrophages to IFNAR signaling.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

"236";"31360262";"Characterization of T-Cell Receptor Repertoire in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis Receiving Biologic Therapies.";" <AbstractText>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systematic autoimmune disease, predominantly causing chronic polyarticular inflammation and joint injury of patients. For the treatment of RA, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) have been used to reduce inflammation and to interfere with disease progression through targeting and mediating the immune system. Although the therapeutic effects of bDMARDs in RA patients have been widely reported, whether these drugs also play important roles in T-cell repertoire status is still unclear. We therefore designed the study to identify the role of T-cell repertoire profiles in RA patients with different types of bDMARD treatments. A high-throughput sequencing approach was applied to profile the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRB) repertoire of circulating T lymphocytes in eight patients given adalimumab (anti-TNF-<i>α</i>) with/without the following use of either rituximab (anti-CD20) or tocilizumab (anti-IL6R). We subsequently analyzed discrepancies in the clonal diversity and CDR3 length distribution as well as usages of the V and J genes of TCRB repertoire and interrogated the association between repertoire diversity and disease activities followed by the treatment of bDMARDs in these RA patients. All groups of patients showed well-controlled DAS28 scores (&lt;2.6) after different treatment regimens of drugs and displayed no significant statistical differences in repertoire diversity, distribution of CDR3 lengths, and usage of V and J genes of TCRB. Nonetheless, a trend between overall TCRB repertoire diversity and disease activity scores in all bDMARD-treated RA patients was observed. Additionally, age was found to be associated with repertoire diversity in RA patients treated with bDMARDs. Through the profiling of the TCR repertoire in RA patients receiving different biologic medications, our study indicated an inverse tendency between TCR repertoire diversity and disease activity after biologic treatment in RA patients.</AbstractText> "

Diagnostic validation studies were performed using expression profiling data and potential protein biomarkers from prospective clinical studies of 13 diseases. A candidate drug was examined by a treatment study of a mouse model of arthritis, using phenotypic, immunohistochemical, and cellular analyses as read-outs.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We performed the first systematic analysis of pathways, potential biomarkers, and drug targets in scRNA-seq data from a complex disease, starting with inflamed joints and lymph nodes from a mouse model of arthritis. We found the involvement of hundreds of pathways, biomarkers, and drug targets that differed greatly between cell types. Analyses of scRNA-seq and GWAS data from human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) supported a similar dispersion of pathogenic mechanisms in different cell types. Thus, systems-level approaches to prioritize biomarkers and drugs are needed. Here, we present a prioritization strategy that is based on constructing network models of disease-associated cell types and interactions using scRNA-seq data from our mouse model of arthritis, as well as human RA, which we term multicellular disease models (MCDMs). We find that the network centrality of MCDM cell types correlates with the enrichment of genes harboring genetic variants associated with RA and thus could potentially be used to prioritize cell types and genes for diagnostics and therapeutics. We validated this hypothesis in a large-scale study of patients with 13 different autoimmune, allergic, infectious, malignant, endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as a therapeutic study of the mouse arthritis model.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Overall, our results support that our strategy has the potential to help prioritize diagnostic and therapeutic targets in human disease.</AbstractText> "

The heterozygous variant in IL36RN identified by Sanger sequencing was inherited from his unaffected father, while the heterozygous variant in TNFAIP3 was detected by whole-exome sequencing and was also identified in the patient's AISBL-affected maternal relatives. Further functional studies are required to research whether the variant of TNFAIP3 plays a part in the development of GPP or simply causes the Behçet's disease phenotype. However, our data suggest that whole-exome sequencing for the heterozygous carrier of the IL36RN gene in GPP be used to find the potential second genetic locus.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Japanese Dermatological Association.</CopyrightInformation> "

In rheumatoid arthritis research, this has led to the discovery of important candidate genes which offered novel insights into mechanisms and their possible roles in the cure of the disease. In the last years, data generation has outstripped data analysis and while many studies focused on specific aspects of the disease, a global picture of the disease is not yet accomplished. Here, we analyzed and compared a collection of gene expression information from healthy individuals and from patients suffering under different arthritis conditions from published studies containing the following clinical conditions: early and established rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and arthralgia. We show comprehensive overviews of this data collection and give new insights specifically on gene expression in the early stage, into sex-dependent gene expression, and we describe general differences in expression of different biotypes of genes. Many genes that are related to cytoskeleton changes (actin filament related genes) are differently expressed in early rheumatoid arthritis in comparison to healthy subjects; interestingly, eight of these genes reverse their expression ratio significantly between men and women compared early rheumatoid arthritis and healthy subjects. There are some slighter changes between men and woman between the conditions early and established rheumatoid arthritis. Another aspect are miRNAs and other gene biotypes which are not only promising candidates for diagnoses but also change their expression grossly in average at rheumatoid arthritis and arthralgia compared to the healthy condition. With a selection of intersecting genes, we were able to generate simple classification models to distinguish between healthy and rheumatoid arthritis as well as between early rheumatoid arthritis to other arthritides based on gene expression.</AbstractText> "

To identify downstream effectors, RNA from healthy control fibroblasts was sequenced after miR-125b knockdown and further validated using qPCR and Western blotting. Fibrosis, apoptosis, and proliferation were assessed by Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining for cleaved caspase 3, and annexin V real-time assay in dermal fibroblasts.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Expression of miR-125b was significantly down-regulated in SSc skin biopsy specimens by 53% (median fold change 0.47 [interquartile range 0.35-0.69]; P &lt; 0.001) and in SSc dermal fibroblasts by 47% (median fold change 0.53 [interquartile range 0.36-0.58]; P &lt; 0.001) compared to healthy control skin biopsy specimens and fibroblasts, respectively (n = 10 samples per group). Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and tubastatin A significantly decreased the expression of miR-125b in dermal fibroblasts. MiR-125b knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. RNA-Seq identified BAK1, BMF, and BBC3 as potential targets of miR-125b. Quantitative PCR confirmed that knockdown of miR-125b up-regulated these genes (P &lt; 0.01; n = 12). Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer 1 showed the strongest induction confirmed at the protein level (P &lt; 0.01; n = 10). Consequently, miR-125b knockdown increased apoptosis compared to scrambled control. Accordingly, miR-125b overexpression decreased apoptosis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our findings indicate that miR-125b is down-regulated in SSc skin and primary dermal fibroblasts. MiR-125b down-regulation increases apoptosis and decreases proliferation and α-SMA expression in dermal fibroblasts, indicating that its compensatory, antifibrotic mechanism may be a potential novel therapeutic option.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

A20 <i>C103A</i> cells exhibited enhanced protein citrullination and extracellular trap formation, which could be suppressed by selective PAD4 inhibition. Moreover, SLE-patients with rs2230926 showed increased NETs and increased frequency of autoantibodies to citrullinated epitopes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We propose that genetic alterations disrupting the A20 DUB domain mediate increased susceptibility to SLE through the upregulation of <i>PADI4</i> with resultant protein citrullination and extracellular trap formation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We have hypothesized that plasma exosomes, which play an important role in inter-cellular communication, may play a role in the vascular injury associated with JDM.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">To characterize the circulating exosomes of children with JDM and determine whether the small RNA cargoes within those exosomes are capable of altering transcriptional programs within endothelial cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DESIGN/METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We purified exosomes from plasma samples of children with active, untreated JDM (n = 6) and healthy controls (n = 9). We characterized the small RNA cargoes in JDM and control exosomes by RNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. We then incubated isolated exosomes from healthy controls and children with JDM with cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) for 24 h. Fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm that both control and JDM exosomes were taken up by HAEC. RNA was then purified from HAEC that had been incubated with either control or JDM exosomes and sequenced on the Illumina platform. Differential expression of mRNAs from HAEC incubated with control or JDM exosomes was ascertained using standard computational methods. Finally, we assessed the degree to which differential gene expression in HAEC could be attributed to the different small RNA cargoes in JDM vs control exosomes using conventional and novel analytic methods.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We identified 10 small RNA molecules that showed differential abundance when we compared JDM and healthy control exosomes. Fluorescence microscopy of labeled exosomes confirmed that both JDM and control exosomes were taken up by HAEC. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 59 genes that showed differential expression between HAEC incubated with JDM exosomes vs HAEC incubated with exosomes from controls. Statistical analysis of gene expression data demonstrated that multiple miRNAs exerted transcriptional control on multiple genes with HAEC.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Plasma exosomes from children with active, untreated JDM are taken up by HAEC and are associated with alterations in gene expression in those cells. These findings provide new insight into potential mechanisms leading to the targeting of vascular tissue by the immune system in JDM.</AbstractText> "

Here, we describe four patients with HA20 from two unrelated Chinese families.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"">A total of four patients from two families were included. The average age at onset was 5.9 years. All patients had no signs of eye or skin problems, such as uveitis, rash, folliculitis and dermal abscess. Prior to the recognition of HA20, P1 was diagnosed with SLE, liver fibrosis and hypothyroidism. She also had no oral, genital or perineal ulcers. P2 was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease-related arthritis (IBD-RA). He had a perianal abscess but no oral or genital ulcers. P3, the father of P1 and P2, only had mild oral ulcers, arthralgia, and archosyrinx. P4 was diagnosed with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in two families. WES revealed heterozygous c.559C &gt; T in the TNFAIP3 gene in P1, P2 and P3, while the c.259C &gt; T mutation in the TNFAIP3 gene was identified in P4. The c.259C &gt; T mutations is novel.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">HA20 had a different phenotype between families and even between family members with the same mutation. Liver fibrosis, hypothyroidism, ILD and MAS in the patients with HA20 were first reported in this study.

Recently, a new CARD14 -associated phenotype defined as CAPE (CARD14-associated papulosquamous eruption) with clinical features of both psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris was reported. We describe a family carrying a novel heterozygous mutation in CARD14 gene, with childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis requiring an unusual extremely high dose (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab to achieve disease remission.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We describe a large family with three pairs of twins presenting a clinical phenotype characterized by childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis; in some family members is also reported psoriatic arthritis. The two probands presented poor clinical response to topic and systemic therapy with antihistamine, steroid, retinoids, cyclosporine and etanercept. After exclusion of the most common genes associated to autoinflammatory diseases (IL36RN, IL1RN, MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NLRP12, MEFV, NOD2, PSMB8, PSTPIP1, LPIN2) we approached a new gene search by subjecting to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis five members of the family. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.446 T &gt; G, leading to the missense amino acid substitution p.L149R) in the exon 4 of the CARD14 gene was identified in all affected members. Increasing dosages (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), allowed the complete control of the clinical manifestations, with an evident reduction of circulating Th17 and Th22 CD4+ T cell subsets.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We describe the association of mutations of the CARD14 gene with an erythrodermic psoriasis pedigree, underlying the necessity to investigate CARD14 mutations in childhood-onset psoriasis cases and confirming the presence of CARD14 causative mutations also in erythrodermic psoriasis form, as recently reported. Also in pediatric age, ustekinumab represents a powerful therapeutic option for this rare condition, that is usually refractory to other treatments. In young children, high and frequent dosages allowed a complete control of the clinical manifestations without any severe side effects, with a long-term follow-up.</AbstractText> "
"249";"31275320";"The Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk Gene AIRE Is Induced by Cytokines in Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes and Augments the Pro-inflammatory Response.";" <AbstractText>The autoimmune regulator AIRE controls the negative selection of self-reactive T-cells as well as the induction of regulatory T-cells in the thymus by mastering the transcription and presentation of tissue restricted antigens (TRAs) in thymic cells. However, extrathymic AIRE expression of hitherto unknown clinical significance has also been reported. Genetic polymorphisms of <i>AIRE</i> have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but no specific disease-mediating mechanism has been identified. Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by a systemic immune activation and arthritis. Activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) are key effector cells, mediating persistent inflammation, and destruction of joints. In this study, we identified AIRE as a cytokine-induced RA risk gene in RA FLS and explored its role in these pathogenic stroma cells. Using RNA interference and RNA sequencing we show that AIRE does not induce TRAs in FLS, but augments the pro-inflammatory response induced by tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1β by promoting the transcription of a set of genes associated with systemic autoimmune disease and annotated as interferon-γ regulated genes. In particular, AIRE promoted the production and secretion of a set of chemokines, amongst them CXCL10, which have been associated with disease activity in RA. Finally, we demonstrate that AIRE is expressed in podoplanin positive FLS in the lining layer of synovial tissue from RA patients. These findings support a novel pro-inflammatory role of AIRE at peripheral inflammatory sites and provide a potential pathological mechanism for its association with RA.</AbstractText> "
"250";"31254133";"Osteoclasts Modulate Bone Erosion in Cholesteatoma via RANKL Signaling.";" <AbstractText>Cholesteatoma starts as a retraction of the tympanic membrane and expands into the middle ear, eroding the surrounding bone and causing hearing loss and other serious complications such as brain abscess and meningitis. Currently, the only effective treatment is complete surgical removal, but the recurrence rate is relatively high. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoclasts are known to be responsible for bone erosion and undergo differentiation and activation by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL), which is secreted by synovial fibroblasts, T cells, and B cells. On the other hand, the mechanism of bone erosion in cholesteatoma is still controversial. In this study, we found that a significantly larger number of osteoclasts were observed on the eroded bone adjacent to cholesteatomas than in unaffected areas, and that fibroblasts in the cholesteatoma perimatrix expressed RANKL. We also investigated upstream transcription factors of RANKL using RNA sequencing results obtained via Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, a tool that identifies relevant targets in molecular biology systems. The concentrations of four candidate factors, namely interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor α, and prostaglandin E2, were increased in cholesteatomas compared with normal skin. Furthermore, interleukin-1β was expressed in infiltrating inflammatory cells in the cholesteatoma perimatrix. This is the first report demonstrating that a larger-than-normal number of osteoclasts are present in cholesteatoma, and that the disease involves upregulation of factors related to osteoclast activation. Our study elucidates the molecular basis underlying bone erosion in cholesteatoma.</AbstractText> "

Despite the widespread use of MS-H as a live attenuated vaccine over the past two decades, the precise molecular basis for loss of virulence in this vaccine is not yet fully understood. To address this, the whole genome sequence of the vaccine parent strain, 86079/7NS, was obtained and compared to that of the MS-H vaccine. Except for the <i>vlhA</i> expressed region, both genomes were nearly identical. Thirty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in MS-H, including 11 non-synonymous mutations that were predicted, by bioinformatics analysis, to have changed the secondary structure of the deduced proteins. One of these mutations caused truncation of the <i>oppF-1</i> gene, which encodes the ATP-binding protein of an oligopeptide permease transporter. Overall, the attenuation of MS-H strain may be caused by the cumulative and complex effects of several mutations. The SNPs identified in MS-H were further analyzed by comparing the MS-H and 86079/7NS sequences with the strains WVU-1853 and MS53. In the genomic regions conserved between all strains, 30 SNPs were found to be unique to MS-H lineage. These results have provided a foundation for developing novel biomarkers for the detection of virulence in <i>M. synoviae</i> and also for designing new genotyping assays for discrimination of MS-H from field strains.</AbstractText> "

Musculoskeletal changes such as noninflammatory prominence of interphalangeal joints in hands, feet, and, to a lesser extent, knee joints are common in NBS (up to 85%) and also reported in CSS. We present the case of a 7-year-old boy with polyarthritis of several years' duration (without uveitis), developmental delay, microcephaly, and dysmorphic features reminiscent of NBS. Sanger sequencing of the <i>SMARCA2</i> gene revealed no mutations. Laboratory test results were normal. With synovial biopsy, we confirmed a chronic inflammatory synovitis. Brain MRI revealed dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Treatment with methotrexate and, subsequently, etanercept led to significant clinical improvement. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation in the <i>ARID1B</i> gene, resulting in a premature stop codon (c.C5404T; p.R1802×), a genotype consistent with CSS. The absence of significantly raised inflammatory markers and a clinical diagnosis of a genetic syndrome associated with noninflammatory joint changes may have contributed to this patient's polyarthritis being missed for several years. We propose that some patients with CSS may have inflammatory arthritis (with or without coexisting skeletal dysplasia), which may be helped by treatment as described herein. Early recognition and treatment of inflammatory arthritis in CSS would have a significant impact on reducing disease burden and improving quality of life for patients with this rare genetic syndrome.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</CopyrightInformation> "

Abnormal T cell function is found in autoimmune arthritis. We present the first known case of autoimmune arthritis associated with a novel GATA3 mutation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Whole exome sequencing of the proband was performed on a clinical basis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from the proband, healthy sibling, and parent. cDNA prepared from RNA was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Intracellular proteins were assessed by immunoblot of PBMC homogenates. GATA3 in vitro activity was measured in HeLa cell cultures expressing a mammalian expression vector containing GATA3 or mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis. GATA3 transcriptional activity was examined using a luciferase reporter assay system. T helper cell ex vivo function was evaluated by stimulating PBMCs to differentiate into effector T cells along Th0, Th1, Th2, and Th17 lineages, and re-stimulating effector cells to secrete cytokines. Cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The proband is the first known case of autoimmune arthritis associated with a mutation in GATA3. The proband M401VfsX106 protein is expressed and has a dominant negative function on GATA3 transcriptional activity. The proband PBMCs have markedly increased differentiation along the Th1 and Th17 pathways, with decreased differentiation along the Th2 pathway. Unexpectedly, Th0 cells from the proband express high levels of IFNγ.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our research presents the first known case of autoimmune arthritis associated with a mutation in GATA3. This work expands the phenotypic spectrum of GATA3 mutations. It reveals the novel insight that decreased and altered GATA3 activity coincides with autoimmune arthritis. This work suggests that modulation of GATA3 may be a therapeutic approach for patients with autoimmune arthritis.</AbstractText> "

To identify miRNA dysregulation in SLE, we used miR2Disease and PhenomiR for information about miRNAs exhibiting differential regulation in disease and other biological processes, and HMDD for information about experimentally supported human miRNA-disease association data from genetics, epigenetics, circulating miRNAs, and miRNA-target interactions. This information was incorporated into the miRNA analysis. High-throughput sequencing revealed circulating miRNAs associated with kidney damage in patients with SLE. As the main finding of our in silico analysis of miRNAs differentially expressed in SLE and their interactions with disease-susceptibility genes, post-translational modifications, and transcription factors; we highlight 226 miRNAs associated with genes and processes. Moreover, we highlight that alterations of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, and hsa-miR-324-3p are most commonly associated with post-translational modifications. In addition, altered miRNAs that are most frequently associated with susceptibility-related genes are hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-374a-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-31-5p, and hsa-miR-1-3p.</AbstractText> "

Clonal expansion, mutation load and clonal overlap were assessed in samples collected before, at week 4 and at week 16 or 24 after treatment and correlated to the patients' clinical response.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">After 4 weeks of rituximab-induced B cell depletion, the peripheral blood BCR repertoire of treated patients consisted of fewer, more dominant and more mutated BCR clones. No significant changes in the synovial tissue BCR repertoire were detected until week 16 post-treatment, when a reduced clonal overlap with baseline and an increased mutation load were observed. In patients who were non-responders at month 3 (n=5) using the European League Against Rheumatism response criteria, peripheral blood samples taken at week 4 after rituximab treatment showed more dominant clones compared with moderate responders (n=9) (median (IQR): 36 (27-52) vs 18 (16-26); p&lt;0.01) and more clonal overlap with the baseline (median (IQR): 5% (2%-20%) vs 0% (0%-0%); p≤0.01).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Significant changes in BCR clonality are observed in peripheral blood of patients 4 weeks after rituximab treatment, while changes in synovial tissue were observed at later time points.

"256";"31216373";"The cytokine network type I IFN-IL-27-IL-10 is augmented in murine and human lupus.";" <AbstractText>IL-10 is elevated in the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Here, we show that conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) from predisease lupus-prone B6.NZM Sle1/Sle2/Sle3 triple congenic (TCSle) mice produce more IL-10 than wild-type congenic cDCs upon TLR stimulation, and this overproduction is prevented by blocking the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) with specific Abs. Priming wild-type cDCs with type I IFN mimics the IL-10 overproduction of TCSle cDCs. The MAPK ERK is more phosphorylated in lupus cDCs, partially contributing to IL-10 overproduction. Moreover, we found that TCSle cDCs express higher levels of IL-27 upon TLR7/TLR9 stimulation, and IFNAR blockade reduced IL-27 levels in TCSle cDCs. These results suggest that dysregulated type I IFNs in cDCs contribute to the increased IL-10 and IL-27 in SLE. Since IL-27 neutralization did not inhibit TLR-induced IL-10 production, we propose that type I IFNs enhanced IL-10 in TCSle cDCs independently from IL-27. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis of a cohort of SLE patients reveals higher gene expression of these cytokines in SLE patients expressing a high IFN signature. Since IL-27 and IL-10 have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects, our results also suggest that these cytokines can be modulated by the therapeutic IFN blockade in trials in SLE patients and have complex effects on the autoimmune response.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "

HLA-B27/human β<sub>2</sub> -microglobulin-transgenic (HLA-B27-transgenic) and wild-type rats from dark agouti, Lewis, and Fischer backgrounds were used. Inter-omic analyses using Cytoscape were employed to identify relevant relationships. PICRUSt was used to predict microbial functions based on known metagenomic profiles.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Inter-omic analysis revealed several gut microbes that were strongly associated with dysregulated cytokines driving inflammatory response pathways, such as interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-23, IL-17, IL-1, interferon-γ (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Many microbes were uniquely associated with inflammation in Lewis or Fischer rats, and one was relevant on both backgrounds. Several microbes that were strongly correlated with immune dysregulation were not differentially abundant in HLA-B27-transgenic compared to wild-type controls. A multi-omic network analysis revealed non-overlapping clusters of microbes in Lewis and Fischer rats that were strongly linked to overlapping dysregulated immune/inflammatory genes. Prevotella, Clostridiales, and Blautia were important in Lewis rats, while Akkermansia muciniphila and members of the Lachnospiraceae family dominated in Fischer rats. Inflammation-associated metabolic pathway perturbation (e.g., butanoate, propanoate, lipopolysaccharide, and steroid biosynthesis) was also predicted from both backgrounds.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Inter-omic and network analysis of gut microbes and the host immune response in experimental SpA provides an unprecedented view of organisms strongly linked to dysregulated IL-23, IL-17, IL-1, IFNγ, and TNF. Functional similarities between these organisms may explain why animals of different genetic backgrounds exhibit common patterns of immune dysregulation, possibly through perturbation of similar metabolic pathways.

It is characterised by the painful loss of articular cartilage and is polygenic and multifactorial. Genome-wide association scans have highlighted over 90 osteoarthritis genetic signals, some of which reside within or close to highly plausible candidate genes. An example is an association to polymorphisms within and adjacent to the matrix Gla protein gene MGP. We set out to undertake a functional study of this gene.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Nucleic acid was extracted from cartilage, infrapatellar fat pad, synovium, trabecular bone, trapezium and peripheral whole blood from OA patients and also from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) subjected to chondrogenesis. Expression of MGP was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR), RNA-sequencing and allelic expression imbalance (AEI) analysis. Matrix Gla protein was depleted in chondrocytes by knocking down MGP expression using RNA interference (RNAi) and the effect on a range of genes assessed by qPCR.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">MGP is expressed in joint tissues, blood and chondrocytes cultured from MSCs. There is a higher expression in diseased versus non-diseased cartilage. Polymorphisms that are associated with OA also correlate with the expression of MGP, with the OA risk-conferring allele showing significantly reduced expression in cartilage, fat pad and synovium but increased expression in blood. Depletion of Matrix Gla protein had a significant effect on the majority of genes tested, with an increased expression of catabolic genes that encode enzymes that degrade cartilage.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">MGP expression is subject to cis-acting regulators that correlate with the OA association signal. These are active in a range of joint tissues but have effects which are particularly strong in cartilage. An opposite effect is observed in blood, highlighting the context-specific nature of the regulation of this gene's expression. Recapitulation of the genetic deficit in cartilage chondrocytes is pro-catabolic.</AbstractText> "

The present study aimed to explore differential gene expression in articular cartilage between patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and KBD. Articular cartilages were collected from KBD and RA patients, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by RNA-seq. The signaling pathway and biological process (BP) of the DEGs were identified by enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs and the key genes of KBD were identified by network analysis with STRING and cytoscape software. We identified 167 immune-related DEGs in articular cartilage samples from KBD patients compared with RA. The up-regulation of MAPK signaling pathway and the down-regulation of signaling pathways such as toll-like receptor, janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription, leukocyte migration, T-cell receptor and chemokine, and antigen processing and presentation were involved in KBD. We identified 137 genes nodes related with immune and mapped the PPI network diagram. BP analysis revealed that immune response, calcium ion homeostasis, blood vessel morphogenesis, inflammatory response, lymphocyte proliferation, and MAPK activation were involved in KBD. In conclusion, gene expression profiling can be used to identify the different mechanism of pathogenesis between KBD and RA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation> "

However, the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in OA synovium remains basically unidentified. The current study intended to divulge the expression profile of circRNAs in OA synovium and investigate the possible molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in synovitis in OA through an integrated bioinformatics analysis. A total of 35 synovium samples were collected, including 17 from patients with knee OA and 18 from controls. circRNA sequencing was then carried out on five OA synovium samples as well as five controls to explore the expression pattern of the circRNAs. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was done to confirm the manifestation levels of six differentially expressed circRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses were done for differentially expressed circRNAs using the DAVID database to annotate the functions. The circRNA-miRNA coexpression network was then created to estimate the probable molecular regulatory mechanisms of specifically expressed circRNAs in OA synovium. Total of 122 circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in OA synovium through RNA sequencing. The expressions of five downregulated circRNAs as well as an upregulated circRNA were confirmed through the use of qRT-PCR. The circRNA-miRNA network was created to annotate the probable molecular regulatory mechanisms of specifically expressed circRNAs. Our outcomes revealed that circRNAs might be incorporated in the initiation as well as development of OA synovitis and might have prospective importance in OA diagnosis and therapy.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "
"262";"31182740";"Oral microbial dysbiosis linked to worsened periodontal condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients.";" <AbstractText>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. Individuals with RA have a higher risk of periodontitis and periodontitis has been linked to RA through the production of enzymes by periodontal pathogens that citrullinate proteins. This linkage is supported by findings that periodontitis is associated with increased RA severity and treatment of periodontitis can improve the symptoms of RA. The possible mechanism for this association is through dysbiosis of the oral microbiota triggered by RA-induced systemic inflammation. We examined the RA status of subjects by measuring the number of tender and swollen joints, anti-citrullinated protein antibody and rheumatoid factor. Periodontal disease status and salivary cytokine levels were measured, and dental plaque analyzed by 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing. RA patients had a higher bacterial load, a more diverse microbiota, an increase in bacterial species associated with periodontal disease, more clinical attachment loss, and increased production of inflammatory mediators including IL-17, IL-2, TNF, and IFN-γ. Furthermore, changes in the oral microbiota were linked to worse RA conditions. Our study provides new insights into the bi-directional relationship between periodontitis and RA and suggest that monitoring the periodontal health of RA patients is particularly important.</AbstractText> "

We previously reported the in vitro cytotoxic activity of F. psychrophilum on rainbow trout myoblast, however little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the in vivo pathogenesis in skeletal muscle. In this study, we examined the transcriptomic profiles of skeletal muscle tissue of rainbow trout intraperitoneally challenged with low infection dose of F. psychrophilum. Using high-throughput RNA-seq, we found that 233 transcripts were up-regulated, mostly associated to ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and apoptosis. Conversely, 189 transcripts were down-regulated, associated to skeletal muscle contraction. This molecular signature was consistent with creatine kinase activity in plasma and oxidative damage in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the increased caspase activity suggests as a whole skeletal muscle atrophy induced by F. psychrophilum. This study offers an integrative analysis of the skeletal muscle response to F. psychrophilum infection and reveals unknown aspects of its pathogenesis in rainbow trout.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

A key next step is the identification of target genes and the molecular mechanisms through which this genetic risk operates. The majority of OA risk-conferring alleles are predicted to act by modulating gene expression. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides may be a functional conduit through which this occurs and is detectable by mapping methylation quantitative trait loci, or mQTLs. This approach can therefore provide functional insight into OA risk and will prioritize genes for subsequent investigation. That was our goal, with a focus on the largest set of OA loci yet to be reported.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHOD"">We investigated DNA methylation, genotype and RNA sequencing data derived from the cartilage of patients who had undergone arthroplasty and combined this with in silico analyses of expression quantitative trait loci, epigenomes and chromatin interactions.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We investigated 42 OA risk loci and in ten of these we identified 24 CpGs in which methylation correlated with genotype (false discovery rate (FDR) P-values ranging from 0.049 to 1.73x10<sup>-25</sup>). In silico analyses of these mQTLs prioritised genes and regulatory elements at the majority of the ten loci, with COLGALT2 (encoding a collagen galactosyltransferase), COL11A2 (encoding a polypeptide chain of type XI collagen) and WWP2 (encoding a ubiquitin ligase active during chondrogenesis) emerging as particularly compelling target genes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">We have highlighted the pivotal role of DNA methylation as a link between genetic risk and OA and prioritized genes for further investigation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Abundances of cell types were assessed by CIBERSORT and cell-specific effects by interaction terms in linear models. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used to train classifiers (linear discriminant analysis) of SLE versus healthy individuals in 80% of the dataset and were validated in the remaining 20% running 1000 iterations. Transcriptome/genotypes were integrated by expression-quantitative trail loci (eQTL) analysis; tissue-specific genetic causality was assessed by regulatory trait concordance (RTC).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">SLE has a 'susceptibility signature' present in patients in clinical remission, an 'activity signature' linked to genes that regulate immune cell metabolism, protein synthesis and proliferation, and a 'severity signature' best illustrated in active nephritis, enriched in druggable granulocyte and plasmablast/plasma-cell pathways. Patients with SLE have also perturbed mRNA splicing enriched in immune system and interferon signalling genes. A novel transcriptome index distinguished active versus inactive disease-but not low disease activity-and correlated with disease severity. DEGs discriminate SLE versus healthy individuals with median sensitivity 86% and specificity 92% suggesting a potential use in diagnostics. Combined eQTL analysis from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and SLE-associated genetic polymorphisms demonstrates that susceptibility variants may regulate gene expression in the blood but also in other tissues.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Specific gene networks confer susceptibility to SLE, activity and severity, and may facilitate personalised care.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The etiology of uveitis is complex, and autoimmunity plays a major role in its pathogenesis. Intermediate uveitis (IU), a subtype of ocular inflammation, has been associated with systemic autoimmune disorders, specifically with multiple sclerosis (MS). This article reports a rare three-generation family with several members affected by IU (four siblings) and comorbid MS (two siblings fulfilling MS diagnostic criteria and a third sibling presenting some neurological symptoms). Based on the clinical findings, we captured and sequenced whole exomes of seven pedigree members (affected and unaffected). Using a recessive model of transmission with full penetrance, we applied genetic linkage analysis to define minimal critical regions (MCRs) in suggestive or nominal regions of linkage. In these MCRs, we defined functional (some pathogenic), novel, and rare mutations that segregated as homozygous in affected and heterozygous in unaffected family members. The genes harboring these mutations, including DGKI, TNFRSF10A, GNGT1, CPAMD8, and BAFF, which are expressed in both eye and brain tissues and/or are related to autoimmune diseases, provide new avenues to evaluate the inherited causes of these devastating autoimmune conditions.</AbstractText> "
"267";"31156645";"OTUD6B-AS1 Might Be a Novel Regulator of Apoptosis in Systemic Sclerosis.";" <AbstractText>Antisense long non-coding RNAs (AS lncRNAs) have increasingly been recognized as important regulators of gene expression and they have been found to play key roles in several diseases. However, very little is known about the role of AS lncRNAs in fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis (SSc). Our recent screening experiments by RNA sequencing showed that ovarian tumor domain containing 6B antisense RNA1 (OTUD6B-AS1) and its sense gene OTUD6B were significantly downregulated in SSc skin biopsies. Therefore, we aimed to identify key regulators of OTUD6B-AS1 and to analyze the functional relevance of OTUD6B-AS1 in SSc. OTUD6B-AS1 and OTUD6B expression in SSc and healthy control (HC) dermal fibroblasts (Fb) after stimulation with transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was analyzed by qPCR. To identify the functional role of OTUD6B-AS1, dermal Fb or human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMC) were transfected with a locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting OTUD6B-AS1. Proliferation was measured by BrdU and real-time proliferation assay. Apoptosis was measured by Caspase 3/7 assay and Western blot for cleaved caspase 3. While no difference was recorded at the basal level between HC and SSc dermal Fb, the expression of OTUD6B-AS1 and OTUD6B was significantly downregulated in both SSc and HC dermal Fb after PDGF stimulation in a time-dependent manner. Only mild and inconsistent effects were observed with TGFβ, IL-4, and IL-13. OTUD6B-AS1 knockdown in Fb and HPASMC did not affect extracellular matrix or pro-fibrotic/proinflammatory cytokine production. However, OTUD6B-AS1 knockdown significantly increased Cyclin D1 expression at the mRNA and protein level. Moreover, silencing of OTUD6B-AS1 significantly reduced proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in both dermal Fb and HPASMC. OTUD6B-AS1 knockdown did not affect OTUD6B expression at the mRNA level and protein level. Our data suggest that OTUD6B-AS1 regulates proliferation and apoptosis via cyclin D1 expression in a sense gene independent manner. This is the first report investigating the function of OTUD6B-AS1. Our data shed light on a novel apoptosis resistance mechanism in Fb and vascular smooth muscle cells that might be relevant for pathogenesis of SSc.</AbstractText> "

Gene expression profile indicated that B cell signalling and activation, lipid/saccharide metabolism and endocytosis pathways were abnormally upregulated in lupus AtMs. In addition, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway was remarkably activated in lupus AtMs, and blocking mTORC1 signalling by rapamycin abolished the generation of T-bet<sup>+</sup> B cells and terminal differentiation of lupus AtMs. Furthermore, lupus AtMs displayed a dysfunctional phenotype, underwent accelerated apoptosis, poorly co-stimulated T cells and produced proinflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, lupus AtMs were in a paradoxically differentiated status with markers pro and against terminal differentiation and enriched with antinucleosome reactivity. Finally, AtMs were accumulated in the kidneys of patients with lupus nephritis and associated with disease severity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">These findings demonstrated that mTORC1-overactivated lupus AtMs are abnormally differentiated with metabolic and functional dysregulations.

"270";"31130957";"Identification of Renal Long Non-coding RNA RP11-2B6.2 as a Positive Regulator of Type I Interferon Signaling Pathway in Lupus Nephritis.";" <AbstractText><b>Objective:</b> Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Type I interferon (IFN-I) is associated with the pathogenesis of LN. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE, however, the roles of lncRNAs in LN are still poorly understood. Here, we identified and investigated the function of LN-associated lncRNA RP11-2B6.2 in regulating IFN-I signaling pathway. <b>Methods:</b> RNA sequencing was used to analyze the expression of lncRNAs in kidney biopsies from LN patients and controls. Antisense oligonucleotides and CRISPRi system or overexpression plasmids and CRISPRa system were used to perform loss or gain of function experiments. <i>In situ</i> hybridization, imaging flow cytometry, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and ATAC sequencing were used to study the functions of lncRNA RP11-2B6.2. RT-qPCR, ELISA, and western blotting were done to detect RNA and protein levels of specific genes. <b>Results:</b> Elevated lncRNA RP11-2B6.2 was observed in kidney biopsies from LN patients and positively correlated with disease activity and IFN scores. Knockdown of lncRNA RP11-2B6.2 in renal cells inhibited the expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), while overexpression of lncRNA RP11-2B6.2 enhanced ISG expression. Knockdown of LncRNA RP11-2B6.2 inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK1, TYK2, and STAT1 in IFN-I pathway, while promoted the chromatin accessibility and the transcription of SOCS1. <b>Conclusion:</b> The expression of lncRNAs is abnormal in the kidney of LN. LncRNA RP11-2B6.2 is a novel positive regulator of IFN-I pathway through epigenetic inhibition of SOCS1, which provides a new therapeutic target to alleviate over-activated IFN-I signaling in LN.</AbstractText> "

It is thought that many common variant gene loci of weak effect act additively to predispose to common autoimmune diseases, while the contribution of rare variants remains unclear. Here we describe that rare coding variants in lupus-risk genes are present in most SLE patients and healthy controls. We demonstrate the functional consequences of rare and low frequency missense variants in the interacting proteins BLK and BANK1, which are present alone, or in combination, in a substantial proportion of lupus patients. The rare variants found in patients, but not those found exclusively in controls, impair suppression of IRF5 and type-I IFN in human B cell lines and increase pathogenic lymphocytes in lupus-prone mice. Thus, rare gene variants are common in SLE and likely contribute to genetic risk.</AbstractText> "

Epigenomic analysis revealed persistent H3K27 acetylation and increased chromatin accessibility in regulatory elements associated with FSGs in TNF-stimulated FLS. The accessible regulatory elements of FSGs were enriched in binding motifs for nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). Inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) proteins, which interact with histone acetylation, suppressed sustained induction of FSGs by TNF.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our genome-wide analysis has identified the escape of genes from transcriptional repression in FLS as a novel mechanism potentially contributing to the chronic unremitting synovitis observed in RA.

"274";"31085070";"Transitional B cells in quiescent SLE: An early checkpoint imprinted by IFN.";" <AbstractText>Systemic lupus (SLE) is characterized by a break of B cell tolerance that plays a central role in disease pathophysiology. An early checkpoint defect occurs at the transitional stage leading to the survival of autoreactive B cells and consequently the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. The main purpose of our work was to determine whether transitional B cells, as the most immature naïve B cell subset upstream of pathogenic B cells, display specific features compared to healthy non SLE subjects. Through extensive analysis of transitional B cells from untreated or low treated, mostly Caucasian, SLE patients, we demonstrated that transitional (T1 and T2) B cell frequencies were increased in SLE and positively correlated with disease activity. SLE transitional B cells displayed defects in two closely inter-related molecules (i.e. TLR9 defective responses and CD19 downregulation). RNA sequencing of sorted transitional B cells from untreated patients revealed a predominant overexpression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) even out of flares. In addition, early transitional B cells from the bone marrow displayed the highest interferon score, reflecting a B cell interferon burden of central origin. Hence, the IFN signature in transitional B cells is not confined to African American SLE patients and exists in quiescent disease since the medullary stage. These results suggest that in SLE these 3 factors (i.e. IFN imprintment, CD19 downregulation and TLR9 responses impairment) could take part at the early transitional B cell stage in B cell tolerance by-pass, ultimately leading in periphery to the expansion of autoantibodies-secreting cells.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we defined distinct macrophage subsets in the joints of patients with the autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which affects ~1% of the population. The subset we refer to as HBEGF<sup>+</sup> inflammatory macrophages is enriched in RA tissues and is shaped by resident fibroblasts and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These macrophages promoted fibroblast invasiveness in an epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent manner, indicating that intercellular cross-talk in this inflamed setting reshapes both cell types and contributes to fibroblast-mediated joint destruction. In an ex vivo synovial tissue assay, most medications used to treat RA patients targeted HBEGF<sup>+</sup> inflammatory macrophages; however, in some cases, medication redirected them into a state that is not expected to resolve inflammation. These data highlight how advances in our understanding of chronically inflamed human tissues and the effects of medications therein can be achieved by studies on local macrophage phenotypes and intercellular interactions.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This study aimed to evaluate whether a strontium compound (in the form of strontium gluconate, Glu-Sr) could reduce OA pathology severity in osteoarthritic rat models by directly targeting chondrocytes, including catabolic/anabolic activities and/or chondrogenic differentiation. Glu-Sr was administered to OA rats by oral gavage beginning during OA induction and continuing for 8 weeks. Glu-Sr treatment was found to significantly reduce cartilage degeneration and delay OA progression. Further examination showed that collagen II, Sox9, and aggrecan (ACAN) genes were up-regulated whereas IL-1β was down-regulated in chondrocytes isolated from Glu-Sr-treated rats. Glu-Sr also antagonized the catabolic effects of IL-1β on chondrocytes. Furthermore, Glu-Sr was shown to promote the chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), possibly through promoting chondrogenic gene expression, including CTGF and FGF1, as revealed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). These results suggest that systemic administration of Glu-Sr may be useful in prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of chronic cartilage degradation through affecting multiple steps from chondrogenic differentiation of progenitors to matrix formation in mature chondrocytes.</AbstractText> "

Among various cytokines, interleukin-1β plays a central role in driving catabolic processes, ultimately resulting in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and a diminished collagen synthesis, both of which promote tendon extracellular matrix degradation. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy is often used for pain management, osteoarthritis, and delayed wound healing. In vitro PEMF treatment of tendon-derived cells was shown to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially limiting their catabolic effects. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remains limited. We therefore investigated the transcriptome-wide responses of Il-1β-primed rat Achilles tendon cell-derived 3D tendon-like constructs to high-energy PEMF treatment. RNASeq analysis and gene ontology assignment revealed various biological processes to be affected by PEMF, including extracellular matrix remodeling and negative regulation of apoptosis. Further, we show that members of the cytoprotective Il-6/gp130 family and the Il-1β decoy receptor Il1r2 are positively regulated upon PEMF exposure. In conclusion, our results provide fundamental mechanistic insight into the cellular and molecular mode of action of PEMF on tendon cells and can help to optimize treatment protocols for the non-invasive therapy of tendinopathies.</AbstractText> "

Our aim is to investigate these loci and explore how they may lead to the development of PsA. We evaluated this potential by investigating the genes connected with these loci from the perspective of pharmacogenomics and gene expression. We illustrated that markers with suggestive evidence of association outside the MHC region are enriched in H3K27ac marks for osteoblast and chondrogenic differentiated cells; using pharmacogenomics resources, we showed that genes near these markers are targeted by existing drugs used to treat psoriatic arthritis. Significantly, six of the ten suggestive significant loci overlapping the regulatory elements encompass genes differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 5%) in differentiated osteoblasts, including genes participating in the Wnt signaling such as <i>RUNX1</i>, <i>FUT8</i>, and <i>CTNNAL1</i>. Our approach shows that epigenomic information can be used as cost-effective approach to enhance the inferences for GWAS results, especially in situations when few genome-wide significant loci are available. Our results also point the way to more directed investigations comparing the genetics of PsA and PsC.</AbstractText> "
"283";"31022271";"Insights from deconvolution of cell subtype proportions enhance the interpretation of functional genomic data.";" <AbstractText>Cell subtype proportion variability between samples contributes significantly to the variation of functional genomic properties such as gene expression or DNA methylation. Although the impact of the variation of cell subtype composition on measured genomic quantities is recognized, and some innovative tools have been developed for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, most functional genomics studies using samples with mixed cell types still ignore the influence of cell subtype proportion variation, or just deal with it as a nuisance variable to be eliminated. Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data can provide insights into cellular changes associated with phenotypes. We focused on two types of mixed cell populations, human blood and mouse kidney. Cell type prediction is well developed in the former, but not currently in the latter. Estimating the cellular repertoire is easier when a reference dataset from purified samples of all cell types in the tissue is available, as is the case for blood. However, reference datasets are not available for most other tissues, such as the kidney. In this study, we showed that the proportion of alterations attributable to changes in the cellular composition varies strikingly in the two disorders (asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that the contribution of cell subtype proportion changes to functional genomic properties can be disease-specific. We also showed that a reference dataset from a single-cell RNA-seq study successfully estimated the cell subtype proportions in mouse kidney and allowed us to distinguish altered cell subtype differences between two different knock-out mouse models, both of which had reported a reduced number of glomeruli compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings demonstrate that testing for changes in cell subtype proportions between conditions can yield important insights in functional genomics studies.</AbstractText> "

The retinal transcriptome from the TMP eye drop-treated and the untreated mice was identified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) strategy. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by real-time PCR. The protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING software. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Compared with the TMP-treated group, the inflammatory responses of the untreated control group were much severe and clinical score was remarkably higher (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) at 24 h after lipopolysaccharide administration. RNA-seq assay identified 407 DEGs, among which 356 were upregulated and 51 were downregulated. There were 12 upregulated gene ontology terms enriched and 27 upregulated pathways. Seven DEGs, including inflammation-related, complement system-related, and interferon-related genes, were validated using quantitative PCR. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> TMP exerted anti-inflammatory effect in EIU. Local application of TMP inhibited retinal inflammatory response by regulating the inflammation-related genes, suggesting that TMP may be a potential novel therapeutic drug for ocular inflammation.</AbstractText> "

The mechanisms underlying CIM remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the biological activities occurring at the transcriptional level in the skeletal muscle of ICU patients with CIM, the gene expression profiles, potential upstream regulators, and enrichment pathways were characterized using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We also compared the skeletal muscle gene signatures in ICU patients with CIM and genes perturbed by mechanical loading in one leg of the ICU patients, with an aim of reducing the loss of muscle function.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">RNA-seq was used to assess gene expression changes in tibialis anterior skeletal muscle samples from seven critically ill, immobilized, and mechanically ventilated ICU patients with CIM and matched control subjects. We also examined skeletal muscle gene expression for both legs of six ICU patients with CIM, where one leg was mechanically loaded for 10 h/day for an average of 9 days.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In total, 6257 of 17,221 detected genes were differentially expressed (84% upregulated; p &lt; 0.05 and fold change ≥ 1.5) in skeletal muscle from ICU patients with CIM when compared to control subjects. The differentially expressed genes were highly associated with gene changes identified in patients with myopathy, sepsis, long-term inactivity, polymyositis, tumor, and repeat exercise resistance. Upstream regulator analysis revealed that the CIM signature could be a result of the activation of MYOD1, p38 MAPK, or treatment with dexamethasone. Passive mechanical loading only reversed expression of 0.74% of the affected genes (46 of 6257 genes).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">RNA-seq analysis revealed that the marked muscle atrophy and weakness observed in ICU patients with CIM were associated with the altered expression of genes involved in muscle contraction, newly identified E3 ligases, autophagy and calpain systems, apoptosis, and chaperone expression.

Various splice variants of <i>POSTN</i> have been described; however, their expression pattern and functional implications are not completely understood. This study was undertaken to decipher the differential expression pattern of <i>POSTN</i> and its splice variants in various tissues and cell types. We show that <i>POSTN</i> was more highly expressed in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) remnants compared with articular cartilage at the cellular and tissue level. Isoforms 1 and 8 were highly expressed only in articular chondrocytes, suggesting their splice-specific regulation in chondrocytes. To discern the role of total <i>POSTN</i> and full-length human POSTN isoform 1 (<i>hPOSTN-001</i>), we stably transfected human chondrosarcoma 1 (hCh-1) cell line with <i>hPOSTN-001</i> using a pcDNA3.1-hPOSTN-001 construct. RNA-sequencing analysis of hCh-1 cells identified differentially expressed genes with a known role in chondrocyte function and osteoarthritis. Similar expression of a subset of candidate genes was revealed in ACL progenitor cells and chondrocytes as well as in ACL progenitor cells in which <i>POSTN</i> activity was altered by overexpression and by small interfering RNA gene knockdown. Cells expressing total <i>POSTN</i>, not isoform 1, exhibited increased cell adhesion potential. These findings suggest an important role for <i>POSTN</i> in the knee.-Cai, L., Brophy, R.

We enrolled six treatment-naive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients whose blood samples were collected for phenotypic and molecular studies along with 12-week iguratimod monotherapy.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Iguratimod inhibited human ASC generation without affecting B cell activation and proliferation. Iguratimod showed only weak COX-2 activity. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified that protein kinase C (PKC) pathway was targeted by iguratimod which was confirmed by PKC activity detection. Furthermore, early growth response 1 (EGR1), a target of PKC and a non-redundant TF for ASC differentiation, was found to be the most downregulated gene in iguratimod-treated B cells. Lastly, iguratimod monotherapy decreased peripheral ASCs and was associated with improved disease activity. The expression of major ASC-related TFs, including EGR1, was similarly downregulated in patient blood samples.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Iguratimod inhibits ASC differentiation both in vitro and in RA patients. Our study suggests that PKC/EGR1 axis, rather than COX-2, is critically involved in the inhibitory effect by iguratimod on human ASC differentiation.

To identify the underlying molecular mechanisms, we longitudinally profiled the blood transcriptome of 92 lupus patients and 43 healthy women during pregnancy and postpartum and performed multicolor flow cytometry in a subset of them. We also profiled 25 healthy women undergoing assisted reproductive technology to monitor transcriptional changes around embryo implantation. Sustained down-regulation of multiple immune signatures, including interferon and plasma cells, was observed during healthy pregnancy. These changes appeared early after embryo implantation and were mirrored in uncomplicated lupus pregnancies. Patients with preeclampsia displayed early up-regulation of neutrophil signatures that correlated with expansion of immature neutrophils. Lupus pregnancies with fetal complications carried the highest interferon and plasma cell signatures as well as activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts. Thus, blood immunomonitoring reveals that both healthy and uncomplicated lupus pregnancies exhibit early and sustained transcriptional modulation of lupus-related signatures, and a lack thereof associates with adverse outcomes.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Hong et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

It is known that individuals with multiple X-chromosomes are at increased risk for developing SLE; however, the mechanisms underlying this genetic basis are unclear. Here, we use single cell imaging to determine the epigenetic features of the inactive X (Xi) in developing thymocytes, mature T cell subsets, and T cells from SLE patients and mice. We show that Xist RNA and heterochromatin modifications transiently reappear at the Xi and are missing in mature single positive T cells. Activation of mature T cells restores Xist RNA and heterochromatin marks simultaneously back to the Xi. Notably, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) maintenance is altered in T cells of SLE patients and late-stage-disease NZB/W F1 female mice, and we show that X-linked genes are abnormally upregulated in SLE patient T cells. SLE T cells also have altered expression of XIST RNA interactome genes, accounting for perturbations of Xi epigenetic features. Thus, abnormal XCI maintenance is a feature of SLE disease, and we propose that Xist RNA localization at the Xi could be an important factor for maintaining dosage compensation of X-linked genes in T cells.</AbstractText> "

The clinical success of IL17A neutralizing biologics in psoriasis has underlined its importance as a drug discovery target. While many studies have focused on the differentiation and trafficking of IL17A producing T-helper 17 cells, less is known about IL17A-initiated signaling events in stromal and parenchymal cells leading to psoriatic phenotypes. We sought to discover signaling nodes downstream of IL17A contributing to disease pathogenesis. Using IL17A and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) to stimulate primary human epidermal keratinocytes, we employed two different phenotypic screening approaches. First, a library of ∼22000 annotated compounds was screened for reduced secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL8. Second, a library of 729 kinases was screened in a pooled format by utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 and monitoring IL8 intracellular staining. The highest-ranking novel hits identified in both screens were the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins and bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2), respectively. Comparison of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 silencing with siRNA and CRISPR confirmed that BRD2 was responsible for mediating IL8 production. Pan-BRD inhibitors and BRD2 knockout also reduced IL17A/TNF-mediated CXC motif chemokines 1/2/6 (CXCL1/2/6) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production. In RNA-Seq analysis, 438 IL17A/TNF dependent genes were reduced in BRD2-deficient primary keratinocytes. KEGG pathway analysis of these genes showed enrichment in TNF signaling and rheumatoid arthritis relevant genes. Moreover, a number of genes important for keratinocyte homeostasis and cornification were dysregulated in BRD2-deficient keratinocytes. In IL17A/TNF/IL22 stimulated three-dimensional organotypic raft cultures, pan-BRD inhibition reduced inflammatory factor production but elicited aberrant cornification, consistent with RNA-Seq analysis. These studies highlight a novel role for BRDs and BRD2 in particular in IL17A-mediated inflammatory signaling.</AbstractText> "

Recent studies showed that the exosomes derived from several types of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could maintain chondrocyte homeostasis and ameliorate the pathological severity of OA in animal models, indicating that MSCs-derived exosomes could be a novel promising strategy for treating OA. In this study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanisms of infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) MSCs-derived exosomes (MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos) on OA in vitro and in vivo. Our data revealed that MSC<sup>IPFP</sup> could produce amounts of MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos, which exhibited the typical morphological features of exosomes. The MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos ameliorated the OA severity in vivo and inhibited cell apoptosis, enhanced matrix synthesis and reduced the expression of catabolic factor in vitro. Moreover, MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos could significantly enhance autophagy level in chondrocytes partially via mTOR inhibition. Exosomal RNA-seq showed that the level of miR-100-5p that could bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of mTOR was the highest among microRNAs. MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos decreased the luciferase activity of mTOR 3'UTR, while inhibition of miR-100-5p could reverse the MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos-decreased mTOR signaling pathway. Intra-articular injection of antagomir-miR-100-5p dramatically attenuated MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos-mediated protective effect on articular cartilage in vivo. In brief, MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-derived exosomes protect articular cartilage from damage and ameliorate gait abnormality in OA mice by maintaining cartilage homeostasis, the mechanism of which may be related to miR100-5p-regulated inhibition of mTOR-autophagy pathway. As it is relatively feasible to obtain human IPFP from OA patients by arthroscopic operation in clinic, MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-derived exosomes may be a potential therapy for OA in the future.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To control the escalating infection of E. trada on various species, it is essential to decoded the mysterious mechanism behind the bacterial infection at transcript level. In this present study, we carry out a de novo E. tarda Whole transcriptome sequencing, isolated from infected fish intestine using SOLiD sequencing platform. RNA-Seq data analysis was performed using various bioinformatics pipelines. Protein-protein interaction study for pathway enrichment and gene ontology study were executed for further investigation. Assembly statistics for E. tarda dataset showed that the number of transcript contigs was 9657 out of which 6749 were GO annotated whereas 1528 were not assigned any GO terms. GO analysis showed that the expressed genes were enhanced with molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A KEGG enrichment study showed that pathway's that are directly linked with immune diseases like Rheumatoid arthritis (0.2%), Tuberculosis (0.3%) Endocytosis (0.6%) was considerably enriched. Protein-protein interaction study showed that most of the expressed proteins were involved in metabolic pathways, flagellar assembly, Propanoate metabolism, Microbial metabolism in diverse environments, Butanoate metabolism and Carbon. The present study provides novel E. tarda transcriptome sequence data, allowing us to identify biologically significant genes and their functional relationship with fish diseases, and will be useful in recognize the reliable therapeutic targets in near feature.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is still no efficient cartilage delivery system or novel magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent (CA). Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel class of MR CA, Gd<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>-based nanoparticles (NPs), from a simpler and &quot;greener&quot; approach than previous ones. After the coating of polydopamine (PDA) onto the Gd<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> core, we further anchored a cartilage-targeting peptide and loaded hesperetin (Hes) into NPs (Hes-Gd<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>@PDA-PEG-DWpeptide, HGdPDW), showing excellent cartilage affinity and MR suitability. Additionally, the synthesized HGdPDW exerted significant protective effects against IL-1β stimulation, as shown by the decreased apoptosis and inflammation and increased maturation of chondrocytes in vitro. More importantly, RNA-seq analyses showed the significant reduction of TLR-2 in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes, and this reduction was followed by the inactivation of NF-κB/Akt signaling, leading to the protective effect of HGdPDW. By the establishment of anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) OA mice, the bimodal MRI/IVIS imaging demonstrated the effective cartilage-binding ability of HGdPDW in OA knees with low cytotoxicity, which alleviated the gradual degeneration of articular cartilage in vivo by inhibiting TLR-2 in chondrocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that HGdPDW could target cartilage effectively, thereby protecting chondrocytes from apoptosis and inflammation via TLR-2/NF-κB/Akt signaling. We hope this new class of MRI CA could be applied in not only other fields using MRI technology but also the treatment of general cartilage-related diseases; this application will undoubtedly extend the treatment of OA clinically.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Via RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and mass spectrometry-based protein expression analyses 136 genes and 56 proteins could be identified as being significantly differentially expressed (DE) between the JIAU and POAG group. Gene expression of different immunoglobulin (Ig) components as well as of the B cell-associated factors ID3, ID1, and EBF1 was significantly upregulated in the JIAU group as compared to POAG patients. qRT-PCR analysis showed a significantly higher gene expression of the B cell-related genes CD19, CD20, CD27, CD138, and MZB1 in the JIAU group. At the protein level, a significantly higher expression of Ig components in JIAU than in POAG was confirmed. The B cell-associated protein MZB1 showed a higher expression in JIAU patients than in POAG which was confirmed by western blot analysis. Using bead-based immunoassay analysis we were able to detect a significantly higher concentration of the B cell-activating and survival factors BAFF, APRIL, and IL-6 in the AqH of JIAU and AAU patients than in POAG patients. The intraocularly upregulated B cell-specific genes and proteins in iris tissue suggest that B cells participate in the immunopathology of JIAU.

Recently, familial cases of systemic-onset JIA have been attributed to mutations in LACC1/FAMIN. We describe three affected siblings from a Moroccan consanguineous family with an early-onset chronic, symmetric and erosive arthritis previously diagnosed as rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarticular JIA. Autozygosity mapping identified four homozygous regions shared by all patients, located in chromosomes 3, 6 (n:2) and 13, containing over 330 genes. Subsequent whole exome sequencing identified two potential candidate variants within these regions (in FARS2 and LACC1/FAMIN). Genotyping of a cohort of healthy Moroccan individuals (n: 352) and bioinformatics analyses finally supported the frameshift c.128_129delGT mutation in the LACC1/FAMIN gene, leading to a truncated protein (p.Cys43Tyrfs*6), as the most probable causative gene defect. Additional targeted sequencing studies performed in patients with systemic-onset JIA (n:23) and RF-negative polyarticular JIA (n: 44) revealed no pathogenic LACC1/FAMIN mutations. Our findings support the homozygous genotype in the LACC1/FAMIN gene as the defect underlying the family here described with a recessively inherited severe inflammatory joint disease. Our evidences provide further support to the involvement of LACC1/FAMIN deficiency in different types of JIA in addition to the initially described systemic-onset JIA.</AbstractText> "

Advances in chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) have made large-scale repositories of epigenetic data available, allowing investigation of coordinated mechanisms of epigenetic markers and transcriptional regulation and their influence on biological function. To address this, we propose SNPs2ChIP, a method to infer biological functions of non-coding variants through unsupervised statistical learning methods applied to publicly-available epigenetic datasets. We systematically characterized latent factors by applying singular value decomposition to ChIP-seq tracks of lymphoblastoid cell lines, and annotated the biological function of each latent factor using the genomic region enrichment analysis tool. Using these annotated latent factors as reference, we developed SNPs2ChIP, a pipeline that takes genomic region(s) as an input, identifies the relevant latent factors with quantitative scores, and returns them along with their inferred functions. As a case study, we focused on systemic lupus erythematosus and demonstrated our method's ability to infer relevant biological function. We systematically applied SNPs2ChIP on publicly available datasets, including known GWAS associations from the GWAS catalogue and ChIP-seq peaks from a previously published study. Our approach to leverage latent patterns across genome-wide epigenetic datasets to infer the biological function will advance understanding of the genetics of human diseases by accelerating the interpretation of non-coding genomes.</AbstractText> "

One target is the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway that consists of the vagus nerve to spleen circuit, which has been stimulated with implantable devices to improve autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Here we report that daily noninvasive ultrasound (US) stimulation targeting the spleen significantly reduces disease severity in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis. Improvements are observed only with specific parameters, in which US can provide both protective and therapeutic effects. Single cell RNA sequencing of splenocytes and experiments in genetically-immunodeficient mice reveal the importance of both T and B cell populations in the anti-inflammatory pathway. These findings demonstrate the potential for US stimulation of the spleen to treat inflammatory diseases.</AbstractText> "

The specific overexpression of a given myositis autoantigen in myositis muscle has been proposed as initiating and/or propagating autoimmunity against that particular autoantigen. The present study was undertaken to test this hypothesis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">In order to quantify autoantigen RNA expression, RNA sequencing was performed on muscle biopsy samples from control subjects, MSA-positive patients with myositis, regenerating mouse muscles, and cultured human muscle cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Muscle biopsy samples were available from 20 control subjects and 106 patients with autoantibodies recognizing hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (n = 40), signal recognition particles (n = 9), Jo-1 (n = 18), nuclear matrix protein 2 (n = 12), Mi-2 (n = 11), transcription intermediary factor 1γ (n = 11), or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (n = 5). The increased expression of a given autoantigen in myositis muscle was not associated with autoantibodies recognizing that autoantigen (all q &gt; 0.05). In biopsy specimens from both myositis muscle and regenerating mouse muscles, autoantigen expression correlated directly with the expression of muscle regeneration markers and correlated inversely with the expression of genes encoding mature muscle proteins. Myositis autoantigens were also expressed at high levels in cultured human muscle cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Most myositis autoantigens are highly expressed during muscle regeneration, which may relate to the propagation of autoimmunity. However, factors other than overexpression of specific autoantigens are likely to govern the development of unique autoantibodies in individual patients with myositis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 American College of Rheumatology.

Among others, these <i>N</i>-linked glycans can affect Ag binding and Ab stability. Elevated <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation has furthermore been associated with several B cell-associated pathologies. Basic knowledge about patterns of V region glycosylation at different stages of B cell development is scarce. The aim of the current study is to establish patterns of <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites in Ab V regions of naive and memory B cell subsets. We analyzed the distribution and acquisition of <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites within Ab V regions of peripheral blood and bone marrow B cells of 12 healthy individuals, eight myasthenia gravis patients, and six systemic lupus erythematosus patients, obtained by next-generation sequencing. <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites are clustered around CDRs and the DE loop for both H and L chains, with similar frequencies for healthy donors and patients. No evidence was found for an overall selection bias against acquiring an <i>N</i>-glycosylation site, except for the CDR3 of the H chain. Interestingly, both IgE and IgG4 subsets have a 2-fold higher propensity to acquire Fab glycans compared with IgG1 or IgA. When expressed as rmAb, 35 out of 38 (92%) nongermline <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites became occupied. These results point toward a differential selection pressure of <i>N</i>-glycosylation site acquisition during affinity maturation of B cells, which depends on the location within the V region and is isotype and subclass dependent. Elevated Fab glycosylation represents an additional hallmark of T<sub>H</sub>2-like IgG4/IgE responses.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

Despite the identification of more than one hundred genetic variants associated with the disease, not all the cases can be explained. Here, we performed Whole Exome Sequencing in 9 multiplex families (N = 30) to identify rare variants susceptible to play a role in the disease pathogenesis. We pre-selected 77 genes which carried rare variants with a complete segregation with RA in the studied families. Follow-up linkage and association analyses with pVAAST highlighted significant RA association of 43 genes (p-value &lt; 0.05 after 106 permutations) and pinpointed their most likely causal variant. We re-sequenced the 10 most significant likely causal variants (p-value ≤ 3.78*10-3 after 106 permutations) in the extended pedigrees and 9 additional multiplex families (N = 110). Only one SNV in SUPT20H: c.73A&gt;T (p.Lys25*), presented a complete segregation with RA in an extended pedigree with early-onset cases. In summary, we identified in this study a new variant associated with RA in SUPT20H gene. This gene belongs to several biological pathways like macro-autophagy and monocyte/macrophage differentiation, which contribute to RA pathogenesis. In addition, these results showed that analyzing rare variants using a family-based approach is a strategy that allows to identify RA risk loci, even with a small dataset.</AbstractText> "

Then, we analyzed the coexpression network of 23 optimized lincRNAs and their corresponding 353 miRNAs, evaluated the cis- and trans-effects of these lincRNAs, and performed GO and KEGG analyses of target genes. We also selected 8 lincRNAs and 2 newly discovered lncRNAs for q-PCR validation and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA analysis. Finally, we also analyzed respectively the relation between lncRNAs and gender bias in SLE patients using RT-qPCR, the relation between Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score and the &quot;IFN signature&quot; using ELISA, and the relation between the differential expression of lncRNAs and a change in the number of a cell type of PBMCs in SLE patients using RT-qPCR.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The profiles of 1087 lncRNAs, 102 miRNAs, and 4101 mRNAs in PBMCs significantly differed between patients with SLE and healthy controls. The coexpression network analysis showed that the network contained 23 lincRNAs and 353 mRNAs. The evaluation of the cis- and trans-effects showed that the 23 lincRNAs acted on 704 target genes. GO and KEGG analyses of the target genes predicted the biological functions of the 23 lincRNAs. q-PCR validation showed 7 lincRNAs and 2 novel lncRNAs were identical to the sequencing results. The ceRNA network contained 7 validated lincRNAs, 15 miRNAs, and 155 mRNAs. In addition, the differential expression of lncRNAs may be gender dependent in SLE patients, SLE patients also exhibit a robust &quot;IFN signature,&quot; and PBMCs exhibiting differential expression of lncRNAs may be due to a change in the number of a cell type.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This work determined specific lncRNAs that play important biological functions in the pathogenesis of lupus and provided a new direction for diagnosis and treatment of disease.</AbstractText> "

Histologic analysis of synovium revealed synovitis in 27% and 31% of samples from patients in remission and patients with low disease activity, respectively. Patients with low disease activity and synovitis also exhibited increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.0006) and increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody levels (P = 0.03) compared to patients without synovitis.

Cannabinoids acting as dual PPARγ/CB<sub>2</sub> agonists, such as VCE-004.8 and Ajulemic acid (AjA), have been shown to alleviate skin fibrosis and inflammation in SSc models. Since both compounds are being tested in humans, we compared their activities in the bleomycin (BLM) SSc model. Specifically, the pharmacotranscriptomic signature of the compounds was determined by RNA-Seq changes in the skin of BLM mice treated orally with AjA or EHP-101, a lipidic formulation of VCE-004.8. While both compounds down-regulated the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory and fibrotic components of the disease and the pharmacotranscriptomic signatures were similar for both compounds in some pathways, we found key differences between the compounds in vasculogenesis. Additionally, we found 28 specific genes with translation potential by comparing with a list of human scleroderma genes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both compounds prevented fibrosis, collagen accumulation and Tenascin C (TNC) expression. The endothelial CD31<sup>+</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and telocytes were reduced in BLM mice and restored only by EHP-101 treatment. Finally, differences were found in plasmatic biomarker analysis; EHP-101, but not AjA, enhanced the expression of some factors related to angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Altogether the results indicate that dual PPARγ/CB2 agonists qualify as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of SSc and other fibrotic diseases. EHP-101 demonstrated unique mechanisms of action related to the pathophysiology of SSc that could be beneficial in the treatment of this complex disease without current therapeutic options.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To characterize the key regulators involved in the development of RA, we obtained multilayer epigenomics data including DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, miRNA profiles, genetic variations by whole-exome sequencing, and mRNA profiles from synoviocytes of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. The overall DNA methylation patterns were not much different between RA and OA, but 523 low-methylated regions (LMRs) were specific to RA. The LMRs were preferentially localized at the 5' introns and overlapped with transcription factor binding motifs for GLI1, RUNX2, and TFAP2A/C. Single base-scale differentially methylated CpGs were linked with several networks related to wound response, tissue development, collagen fibril organization, and the TGF-β receptor signaling pathway. Further, the DNA methylation of 201 CpGs was significantly correlated with 27 expressed miRNA genes. Our interpretation of epigenomic data of the synoviocytes from RA and OA patients is an informative resource to further investigate regulatory elements and biomarkers responsible for the pathophysiology of RA and OA.</AbstractText> "
"312";"30804934";"The Long Non-coding RNA NRIR Drives IFN-Response in Monocytes: Implication for Systemic Sclerosis.";" <AbstractText>TLR4 activation initiates a signaling cascade leading to the production of type I IFNs and of the downstream IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Recently, a number of IFN-induced long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that feed-back regulate the IFN response have been identified. Dysregulation of this process, collectively known as the &quot;Interferon (IFN) Response,&quot; represents a common molecular basis in the development of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Concurrently, alteration of lncRNA profile has been described in several type I IFN-driven autoimmune diseases. In particular, both TLR activation and the upregulation of ISGs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been identified as possible contributors to the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), a connective tissue disease characterized by vascular abnormalities, immune activation, and fibrosis. However, hitherto, a potential link between specific lncRNA and the presence of a type I IFN signature remains unclear in SSc. In this study, we identified, by RNA sequencing, a group of lncRNAs related to the IFN and anti-viral response consistently modulated in a type I IFN-dependent manner in human monocytes in response to TLR4 activation by LPS. Remarkably, these lncRNAs were concurrently upregulated in a total of 46 SSc patients in different stages of their disease as compared to 18 healthy controls enrolled in this study. Among these lncRNAs, Negative Regulator of the IFN Response (NRIR) was found significantly upregulated <i>in vivo</i> in SSc monocytes, strongly correlating with the IFN score of SSc patients. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis showed that NRIR-specific modules, identified in the two datasets, were enriched in &quot;type I IFN&quot; and &quot;viral response&quot; biological processes. Protein coding genes common to the two distinct NRIR modules were selected as putative NRIR target genes. Fifteen <i>in silico</i>-predicted NRIR target genes were experimentally validated in NRIR-silenced monocytes. Remarkably, induction of CXCL10 and CXCL11, two IFN-related chemokines associated with SSc pathogenesis, was reduced in NRIR-knockdown monocytes, while their plasmatic level was increased in SSc patients. Collectively, our data show that NRIR affects the expression of ISGs and that dysregulation of NRIR in SSc monocytes may account, at least in part, for the type I IFN signature present in SSc patients.</AbstractText> "

RNA sequencing was performed in parallel to identify aberrantly expressed genes and their correlation with the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac located nearby their transcription start sites. ChIP-qPCR assays were used to verify the role of bromodomain proteins, H3K27ac and STATs on IFN-responsive gene expression.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">1046 and 534 genomic loci showed aberrant H3K4me3 and H3K27ac marks, respectively, in SSc monocytes. The expression of 381 genes was directly and significantly proportional to the levels of such chromatin marks present near their transcription start site. Genes correlated to altered histone marks were enriched for immune, IFN and antiviral pathways and presented with recurrent binding sites for IRF and STAT transcription factors at their promoters. IFNα induced the binding of STAT1 and STAT2 at the promoter of two of these genes, while blocking acetylation readers using the bromodomain BET family inhibitor JQ1 suppressed their expression.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">SSc monocytes have altered chromatin marks correlating with their IFN signature.

More than half of patients do not carry any pathogenic variant in formerly associated disease genes. Here, we report a cross-sectional study on targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) screening in patients with suspected sAIDs to determine the diagnostic utility of genetic screening. Fifteen autoinflammation/immune-related genes (ADA2-CARD14-IL10RA-LPIN2-MEFV-MVK-NLRC4-NLRP12-NLRP3-NOD2-PLCG2-PSTPIP1-SLC29A3-TMEM173-TNFRSF1A) were used to screen 196 subjects from adult/pediatric clinics, each with an initial clinical suspicion of one or more sAID diagnosis with the exclusion of typical familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients. Following the genetic screening, 140 patients (71.4%) were clinically followed-up and re-evaluated. Fifty rare variants in 41 patients (20.9%) were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 32 of those variants were located on the MEFV gene. We detected pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants compatible with the final diagnoses and inheritance patterns in 14/140 (10%) of patients for the following sAIDs: familial Mediterranean fever (n = 7), deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (n = 2), mevalonate kinase deficiency (n = 2), Muckle-Wells syndrome (n = 1), Majeed syndrome (n = 1), and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (n = 1). Targeted NGS panels have impact on diagnosing rare monogenic sAIDs for a group of patients. We suggest that MEFV gene screening should be first-tier genetic testing especially in regions with high carrier rates. Clinical utility of multi-gene testing in sAIDs was as low as expected, but extensive genome-wide familial analyses in combination with exome screening would enlighten additional genetic factors causing disease.</AbstractText> "

However, the underlying mechanisms of how they work remain unaddressed. Here, we used RNA-set to profile spleen gene expression in adult mice after consistent intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone. We identified 13565 genes in control (injected with 0.9% NaCl) and 13702 genes in dexamethasone-injected group, 12920 genes were expressed in both, but 645 genes were identified only in control and 782 genes were identified only in the dexamethasone group. In the dexamethasone-injected group 101 and 67 genes were down-and up-regulated, respectively. Among these, 129 were coding genes, 19 were identified as non-coding genes or pseudogenes, and the remaining 20 were TEC (to be experimentally confirmed) genes. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway was highly enriched in these differentially expressed genes, and that a majority of the 129 identified coding genes were involved in immune system and cell adhesion-associated processes. Moreover, systemic lupus erythematosus, renin-angiotensin system, fat digestion and absorption, and glycerolipid metabolism pathways were significantly affected in the dexamethasone-treatment group. No obvious signaling pathway was enriched in the control group. Additionally, 20 immunoglobulin heavy or light chain variable region genes (IGH(L)Vs) were down regulated in the dexamethasone-injected group. IGH(L)Vs encode the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain and determine the diversity and specificity of antibodies. We were unable to determine the function of the 19 non-coding genes with differential expression following dexamethasone treatment. Our findings indicate that the expression of IGH(L)Vs and non-coding genes play an important role in the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of dexamethasone and could be developed as potential agents in clinical practice.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There are limited treatment options for SLE and no Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies for CLE. Studies have revealed that IFNs are important mediators for SLE and CLE, but the mechanisms by which IFNs lead to disease are still poorly understood. We aimed to investigate how IFN responses in SLE keratinocytes contribute to development of CLE. A cohort of 72 RNA sequencing samples from 14 individuals (seven SLE and seven healthy controls) were analyzed to study the transcriptomic effects of type I and type II IFNs on SLE versus control keratinocytes. In-depth analysis of the IFN responses was conducted. Bioinformatics and functional assays were conducted to provide implications for the change of IFN response. A significant hypersensitive response to IFNs was identified in lupus keratinocytes, including genes (<i>IFIH1</i>, <i>STAT1</i>, and <i>IRF7</i>) encompassed in SLE susceptibility loci. Binding sites for the transcription factor PITX1 were enriched in genes that exhibit IFN-sensitive responses. PITX1 expression was increased in CLE lesions based on immunohistochemistry, and by using small interfering RNA knockdown, we illustrated that <i>PITX1</i> was required for upregulation of IFN-regulated genes in vitro. SLE patients exhibit increased IFN signatures in their skin secondary to increased production and a robust, skewed IFN response that is regulated by PITX1. Targeting these exaggerated pathways may prove to be beneficial to prevent and treat hyperinflammatory responses in SLE skin.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

Follow-up with whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed a mutation c.2032G&gt;A (p.Gly678Arg) in the COL2A1 gene (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_001844.4), which co-segregated with the disease phenotype in this family, manifested by severe hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis. One of the affected family members had a double-layered patella, which is frequently seen in patients with autosomal recessive MED caused by DTDST mutations and sporadically in the dominant form of MED caused by COL9A2 defect.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

Sleep profiles were determined before inpatient measurements of saliva, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML). Transcriptome and proteome analyses were carried out by RNA-SEQ and LC-MS/MS. Serum samples were analysed by targeted lipidomics, along with serum from mouse collagen induced-arthritis (CIA). Bioinformatic analysis identified RA-specific gene networks and rhythmic processes differing between healthy and RA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">RA caused greater time-of-day variation in PBML gene expression, and ex vivo stimulation identified a time-of-day-specific RA transcriptome. We found increased phospho-STAT3 in RA patients, and some targets, including phospho-ATF2, acquired time-of-day variation in RA. Serum ceramides also gained circadian rhythmicity in RA, which was also seen in mouse experimental arthritis, resulting from gain in circadian rhythmicity of hepatic ceramide synthases.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">RA drives a gain in circadian rhythmicity, both in immune cells, and systemically. The coupling of distant timing information to ceramide synthesis and joint inflammation points to a systemic re-wiring of the circadian repertoire. Circadian reprogramming in response to chronic inflammation has implications for inflammatory co-morbidities and time-of-day therapeutics.</AbstractText> "

Metagenomic analyses of high-throughput data allows for the unbiased identification of potential microbiome pathogens in skin biopsies of SSc patients and allows insight into the relationship with host gene expression.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We examined skin biopsies from a diverse cohort of 23 SSc patients (including lesional forearm and non-lesional back samples) by RNA-seq. Metagenomic filtering and annotation was performed using the Integrated Metagenomic Sequencing Analysis (IMSA). Associations between microbiome composition and gene expression were analyzed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We find the skin of SSc patients exhibits substantial changes in microbial composition relative to controls, characterized by sharp decreases in lipophilic taxa, such as Propionibacterium, combined with increases in a wide range of gram-negative taxa, including Burkholderia, Citrobacter, and Vibrio.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Microbiome dysbiosis is associated with disease duration and increased inflammatory gene expression. These data provide a comprehensive portrait of the SSc skin microbiome and its association with local gene expression, which mirrors the molecular changes in lesional skin.</AbstractText> "

While echocardiography is the most important imaging modality for coronary artery assessment, a specific diagnostic biomarker complementary for CAA has not been reported. We aimed to analyze the profiles of exosomal miRNAs extracted from the serum of KD patients and controls to identify candidate biomarkers for CAA. Serum samples from 39 healthy children, 42 CAA patients, 38 coronary artery dilatation (CAD) patients and 45 virus-infected patients including 24 EBV patients and 21 ADV patients were randomly selected. Next generation sequencing was used to analyze serum exosomal miRNA to detect differentially expressed miRNAs. Biomarker candidates were validated by qRT-PCR. One hundred (and) ninety-six differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were detected in CAA patients and healthy children. There were 70 DEMs and 140 DEMs in CAA patients versus CAD patients, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, respectively. We selected the three most upregulated (let-7i-3p, miR-17-3p, and miR-210-5p) and the three most downregulated miRNAs (miR-6743-5p, miR-1246, and miR-6834-5p) in the DEMs, which were expressed differentially in CAA patients versus healthy children, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, not in virus-infected patients versus healthy children, as biomarker candidates. Excluded DEMs of CAD and virus-infected patients, let-7i-3p was detected by sequence data analysis as a biomarker candidate for CAA patients, and then validated by qRT-PCR in a larger set of clinical samples. As a biomarker candidate, let-7i-3p provides an additional means of diagnosing CAA patients. Additionally, miRNA biomarkers complement ultrasonic imaging, allowing for greater diagnostic precision. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"325";"30718510";"CEMIP (KIAA1199) induces a fibrosis-like process in osteoarthritic chondrocytes.";" <AbstractText>CEMIP (for &quot;Cell migration-inducing protein&quot; also called KIAA1199 and Hybid for &quot;Hyaluronan-binding protein&quot;) expression is increased in cancers and described as a regulator of cell survival, growth and invasion. In rheumatoid arthritis, CEMIP is referred to as an angiogenic marker and participates in hyaluronic acid degradation. In this study, CEMIP expression is investigated in healthy and osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage from human and mouse. Its role in OA physiopathology is deciphered, specifically in chondrocytes proliferation and dedifferentiation and in the extracellular matrix remodeling. To this end, CEMIP, αSMA and types I and III collagen expressions were assessed in human OA and non-OA cartilage. CEMIP expression was also investigated in a mouse OA model. CEMIP expression was studied in vitro using a chondrocyte dedifferentiation model. High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed on chondrocytes after CEMIP silencing. Results showed that CEMIP was overexpressed in human and murine OA cartilage and along chondrocytes dedifferentiation. Most of genes deregulated in CEMIP-depleted cells were involved in cartilage turnover (e.g., collagens), mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. CEMIP regulated β-catenin protein level. Moreover, CEMIP was essential for chondrocytes proliferation and promoted αSMA expression, a fibrosis marker, and TGFβ signaling towards the p-Smad2/3 (Alk5/PAI-1) pathway. Interestingly, CEMIP was induced by the pSmad1/5 (Alk1) pathway. αSMA and type III collagen expressions were overexpressed in human OA cartilage and along chondrocytes dedifferentiation. Finally, CEMIP was co-expressed in situ with αSMA in all OA cartilage layers. In conclusion, CEMIP was sharply overexpressed in human and mouse OA cartilage and along chondrocytes dedifferentiation. CEMIP-regulated transdifferentiation of chondrocytes into &quot;chondro-myo-fibroblasts&quot; expressing α-SMA and type III collagen, two fibrosis markers. Moreover, these &quot;chondro-myo-fibroblasts&quot; were found in OA cartilage but not in healthy cartilage.</AbstractText> "

The mode of inheritance of the genetic risk beyond familial SLE cases is currently unknown. Additionally, the contribution of heterozygous variants in genes known to cause monogenic SLE is not fully understood. Whole-genome sequencing of DNA samples from 71 Swedish patients with SLE and their healthy biological parents was performed to investigate the general genetic risk of SLE using known SLE GWAS risk loci identified using the ImmunoChip, variants in genes associated to monogenic SLE, and the mode of inheritance of SLE risk alleles in these families. A random forest model for predicting genetic risk for SLE showed that the SLE risk variants were mainly inherited from one of the parents. In the 71 patients, we detected a significant enrichment of ultra-rare ( ≤ 0.1%) missense and nonsense mutations in 22 genes known to cause monogenic forms of SLE. We identified one previously reported homozygous nonsense mutation in the C1QC (Complement C1q C Chain) gene, which explains the immunodeficiency and severe SLE phenotype of that patient. We also identified seven ultra-rare, coding heterozygous variants in five genes (C1S, DNASE1L3, DNASE1, IFIH1, and RNASEH2A) involved in monogenic SLE. Our findings indicate a complex contribution to the overall genetic risk of SLE by rare variants in genes associated with monogenic forms of SLE. The rare variants were inherited from the other parent than the one who passed on the more common risk variants leading to an increased genetic burden for SLE in the child. Higher frequency SLE risk variants are mostly passed from one of the parents to the offspring affected with SLE. In contrast, the other parent, in seven cases, contributed heterozygous rare variants in genes associated with monogenic forms of SLE, suggesting a larger impact of rare variants in SLE than hitherto reported.</AbstractText> "

To understand the relationship between host interleukin (IL)-23 signalling and gut bacterial dysbiosis in SpA, we inhibited IL-23 in dysbiotic ZAP-70-mutant SKG mice that develop IL-23-dependent SpA-like arthritis, psoriasis-like skin inflammation and Crohn's-like ileitis in response to microbial beta 1,3-glucan (curdlan).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We treated SKG mice weekly with anti-IL-23 or isotype mAb for 3 weeks, rested them for 3 weeks, then administered curdlan or saline. We collected faecal samples longitudinally, assessed arthritis, spondylitis, psoriasis and ileitis histologically, and analysed the microbiota community profiles using next-generation sequencing. We used multivariate sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis to identify operational taxonomic unit (OTU) signatures best classifying treatment groups and linear regression to develop a predictive model of disease severity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">IL-23p19 inhibition in naïve SKG mice decreased Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Prevotellaceae. Abundance of Clostridiaceae and Lachnospiraceae families concomitantly increased, and curdlan-mediated SpA development decreased.

"329";"30674730";"Macrophage proliferation distinguishes 2 subgroups of knee osteoarthritis patients.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability, globally. Despite an emerging role for synovial inflammation in OA pathogenesis, attempts to target inflammation therapeutically have had limited success. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular processes occurring in the OA synovium is needed to develop novel therapeutics. We investigated macrophage phenotype and gene expression in synovial tissue of OA and inflammatory-arthritis (IA) patients. Compared with IA, OA synovial tissue contained higher but variable proportions of macrophages (P &lt; 0.001). These macrophages exhibited an activated phenotype, expressing folate receptor-2 and CD86, and displayed high phagocytic capacity. RNA sequencing of synovial macrophages revealed 2 OA subgroups. Inflammatory-like OA (iOA) macrophages are closely aligned to IA macrophages and are characterized by a cell proliferation signature. In contrast, classical OA (cOA) macrophages display cartilage remodeling features. Supporting these findings, when compared with cOA, iOA synovial tissue contained higher proportions of macrophages (P &lt; 0.01), expressing higher levels of the proliferation marker Ki67 (P &lt; 0.01). These data provide new insight into the heterogeneity of OA synovial tissue and suggest distinct roles of macrophages in pathogenesis. Our findings could lead to the stratification of OA patients for suitable disease-modifying treatments and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.</AbstractText> "

Previous study reported that autophagy-related gene Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) was likely a susceptible gene for SLE. However, the pathogenic function of LRRK2 in SLE is undefined.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Using quantitative PCR, we compared the expression levels of LRRK2 in B cells between SLE patients and healthy controls. The expression levels of LRRK2 in in vitro induced CD19<sup>hi</sup> B cells and naïve B cells were compared as well based on RNA-seq assay. A pristane-induced lupus-like mouse model was used to explore the effects of LRRK2 on the development of SLE. IgG level, B cell subsets in the spleens and bone marrows and pathological features in the kidneys were compared between wildtype (WT) and Lrrk2<sup>-/-</sup> littermates.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">It was obvious that LRRK2 expression was dramatically up-regulated in primary B cells from SLE patients compared to those from healthy controls, as well as in activated CD19<sup>hi</sup> B cells. More significantly, LRRK2 expression in B cells was positively correlated with system lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI), an indicator for disease severity, and serum IgG levels in SLE patients. Negative correlations were observed between LRRK2 expression and serum C3 or C4 levels, two clinical features associated with SLE-related nephritis. LRRK2 deficiency reduced the death rate of pristane treated mice. Decreased levels of total IgG and autoantibody were detected in the serum with less deposition of immune complexes and attenuated pathological symptoms in the kidneys of Lrrk2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Consistent with the reduction in IgG production, the percentages of germinal center B cells and plasma cells decreased significantly as well with LRRK2 deficiency.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study demonstrates that LRRK2 expression is upregulated in B cells from SLE patients with strong correlations to disease severity. LRRK2 deficiency largely attenuates the pathogenic progress of lupus-like features in pristane-induced mice. This is probably achieved through affecting B cell terminal differentiation and subsequent immunoglobulin production.</AbstractText> "
"331";"30659184";"Hematopoietic PBX-interacting protein mediates cartilage degeneration during the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) has been recognized as the most common chronic age-related disease. Cartilage degeneration influences OA therapy. Here we report that hematopoietic pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor-interacting protein (HPIP) is essential for OA development. Elevated HPIP levels are found in OA patients. Col2a1-CreER<sup>T2</sup>/HPIP<sup>f/f</sup> mice exhibit obvious skeletal abnormalities compared with their HPIP<sup>f/f</sup> littermates. HPIP deficiency in mice protects against developing OA. Moreover, intra-articular injection of adeno-associated virus carrying HPIP-specific short hairpin RNA in vivo attenuates OA histological signs. Notably, in vitro RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing profiles identify that HPIP modulates OA cartilage degeneration through transcriptional activation of Wnt target genes. Mechanistically, HPIP promotes the transcription of Wnt targets by interacting with lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1). Furthermore, HPIP potentiates the transcriptional activity of LEF1 and acetylates histone H3 lysine 56 in the promoters of Wnt targets, suggesting that HPIP is an attractive target in OA regulatory network.</AbstractText> "

Recent studies reported global changes in RNA editing in disease and development. Such widespread editing variations necessitate an improved understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of RNA editing. Here, we study the roles of &gt;200 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in mediating RNA editing in two human cell lines. Using RNA-sequencing and global protein-RNA binding data, we identify a number of RBPs as key regulators of A-to-I editing. These RBPs, such as TDP-43, DROSHA, NF45/90 and Ro60, mediate editing through various mechanisms including regulation of <i>ADAR1</i> expression, interaction with ADAR1, and binding to Alu elements. We highlight that editing regulation by Ro60 is consistent with the global up-regulation of RNA editing in systemic lupus erythematosus. Additionally, most key editing regulators act in a cell type-specific manner. Together, our work provides insights for the regulatory mechanisms of RNA editing.</AbstractText> "

WISP1 expression was determined using immunohistochemistry and damage was classified using Mankin scoring. RNA expression and DNA methylation were assessed in silico from genome-wide datasets (microarray analysis and RNA sequencing, and 450 k-methylationarrays, respectively). Effects of WISP1 were tested in pellet cultures of primary human chondrocytes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">WISP1 expression in cartilage of OA patients was increased compared with non-OA-diagnosed controls and, within OA patients, WISP1 was even higher in lesioned compared with preserved regions, with expression strongly correlating with Mankin score. In early symptomatic OA patients with disease progression, higher synovial WISP1 expression was observed as compared with non-progressors. Notably, increased WISP1 expression was inversely correlated with methylation levels of a positional CpG-dinucleotide (cg10191240), with lesioned areas showing strong hypomethylation for this CpG as compared with preserved cartilage. Additionally, we observed that methylation levels were allele-dependent for an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism nearby cg10191240. Finally, addition of recombinant WISP1 to pellets of primary chondrocytes strongly inhibited deposition of extracellular matrix as reflected by decreased pellet circumference, proteoglycan content and decreased expression of matrix components.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Increased WISP1 expression is found in lesioned human articular cartilage, and appears epigenetically regulated via DNA methylation.

Moreover, we validated the direct and transcriptional regulatory effect of NovelmiRNA-25 on adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (AMPD2) using a dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blot and confirmed AMPD2 mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs using qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Multilayer integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA regulation showed that 10 miRNAs were down-regulated and 19 miRNAs were up-regulated in SLE patient PBMCs compared with HCs. Bioinformatics analysis of regulatory networks between miRNAs and mRNAs showed that 19 miRNAs were related to metabolic processes. Two candidate miRNAs, NovelmiRNA-25 and miR-1273h-5p, which were significantly increased in the PBMCs of SLE patients (P &lt; 0.05), represented diagnostic biomarkers with sensitivities of 94.74% and 89.47%, respectively (area under the curve = 0.574 and 0.788, respectively). NovelmiRNA-25 expression in PBMCs was associated with disease activity in SLE patients, in both active and stable groups (P &lt; 0.05). NovelmiRNA-25 overexpression downregulated AMPD2 expression in HEK293T cells through direct targeting of the AMPD2 3'UTR (P &lt; 0.01), while inhibition of NovelmiRNA-25 activity led to increased AMPD2 expression (P &lt; 0.01).

Improved treatment has been stymied by gaps in understanding key steps in the immunopathogenesis of ARF and rheumatic heart disease. This study aimed to identify (1) effector T cell cytokine(s) that might be dysregulated in the autoimmune response of patients with ARF by group A streptococcus, and (2) an immunomodulatory agent that suppresses this response and could be clinically translatable to high-risk patients with ARF.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The immune response to group A streptococcus was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from an Australian Aboriginal ARF cohort by a combination of multiplex cytokine array, flow cytometric analysis, and global gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing. The immunomodulatory drug hydroxychloroquine was tested for effects on this response.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We found a dysregulated interleukin-1β-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cytokine axis in ARF peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to group A streptococcus in vitro, whereby persistent interleukin-1β production is coupled to overproduction of GM-CSF and selective expansion of CXCR3<sup>+</sup>CCR4<sup>-</sup>CCR6<sup>-</sup> CD4 T cells. CXCR3<sup>+</sup>CCR4<sup>-</sup>CCR6<sup>-</sup> CD4 T cells are the major source of GM-CSF in human CD4 T cells and CXCL10, a CXCR3 ligand and potent T helper 1 chemoattractant, was elevated in sera from patients with ARF. GM-CSF has recently emerged as a key T cell-derived effector cytokine in numerous autoimmune diseases, including myocarditis, and the production of CXCL10 may explain selective trafficking of these cells to the heart. We provide evidence that interleukin-1β amplifies the expansion of GM-CSF-expressing CD4 T cells, which is effectively suppressed by hydroxychloroquine. RNA sequencing showed shifts in gene expression profiles and differentially expressed genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients at different clinical stages of ARF.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Given the safety profile of hydroxychloroquine and its clinical pedigree in treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where GM-CSF plays a pivotal role, we propose that hydroxychloroquine could be repurposed to reduce the risk of rheumatic heart disease after ARF.</AbstractText> "

Structural changes with nerve ingrowth and vascular penetration within OA cartilage may contribute to arthritic joint pain. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes and potential miRNA regulations in OA knee chondrocytes through next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Results suggested the involvement of SMAD family member 3 (<i>SMAD3</i>) and Wnt family member 5A (<i>WNT5A</i>) in the growth of blood vessels and cell aggregation, representing features of cartilage damage in OA. Additionally, 26 dysregulated genes with potential miRNA⁻mRNA interactions were identified in OA knee chondrocytes. Myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate (<i>MARCKS</i>), epiregulin (<i>EREG</i>), leucine rich repeat containing 15 (<i>LRRC15</i>), and phosphodiesterase 3A (<i>PDE3A</i>) expression patterns were similar among related OA cartilage, subchondral bone and synovial tissue arrays in Gene Expression Omnibus database. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified <i>MARCKS</i> to be associated with the outgrowth of neurite, and novel miRNA regulations were proposed to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of the altered OA knee joint microenvironment. The current findings suggest new perspectives in studying novel genes potentially contributing to arthritic joint pain in knee OA, which may assist in finding new targets for OA treatment.</AbstractText> "

Our studies demonstrated that β-arrestin 2 deficiency promoted migration and cytokine production of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs. We further found that β-arrestin 2 directly interacted with Zbtb46, a DC-specific transcription factor. What's more, our results suggested that the interaction between β-arrestin 2 and Zbtb46 might negatively regulate DC migration. Using RNA sequencing, we indicated that genes CD74, NR4A1, and ZFP36 might be the target genes regulated by the interaction between β-arrestin 2 and Zbtb46. Mice with selective deficiency of β-arrestin 2 in DCs developed severer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with more DC infiltration in the CNS and increased IL-6 in serum. In the systemic lupus erythematosus mice model, Arrb2<sup>fl/fl</sup> Itgax-cre<sup>+</sup> mice were prone to exacerbation of lupus nephritis with a higher level of IL-6 and DC accumulation. Taken together, our study identified β-arrestin 2 as a new regulator of DC migration and immune properties, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of autoimmune disease.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

Our previous study has shown that salvianolic acid B (SAB), a bioactive component extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM), was one of the essential ingredients in the traditional Chinese medicine Yiqihuoxue formula, which has been used to treat SSc-related dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of SAB on skin fibrosis and explore its underlying anti-fibrotic mechanism. We found that SAB was capable of alleviating skin fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model, alleviating skin thickness and reducing collagen deposition. in vitro studies indicated that SAB reduced SSc skin fibroblast proliferation and downregulated extracellular matrix gene transcription and collagen protein expression. TGF-β/SMAD and MAPK/ERK pathway activation were also shown to be suppressed in SAB treated fibroblasts. Moreover, RNA-seq revealed that the anti-fibrotic effect of SAB might be related to antioxidant activity, the cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that SAB has the ability to alleviate SSc-related skin fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

"344";"30518690";"Peptidylarginine deiminases 2 and 4 modulate innate and adaptive immune responses in TLR-7-dependent lupus.";" <AbstractText>The peptidylarginine deiminases PAD2 and PAD4 are implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. PAD4 may be pathogenic in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through its role in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation that promotes autoantigen externalization, immune dysregulation, and organ damage. The role of this enzyme in mouse models of autoimmunity remains unclear, as pan-PAD chemical inhibitors improve clinical phenotype, whereas PAD4-KO models have given conflicting results. The role of PAD2 in SLE has not been investigated. The differential roles of PAD2 and PAD4 in TLR-7-dependent lupus autoimmunity were examined. Padi4-/- displayed decreased autoantibodies, type I IFN responses, immune cell activation, vascular dysfunction, and NET immunogenicity. Padi2-/- mice showed abrogation of Th subset polarization, with some disease manifestations reduced compared with WT but to a lesser extent than Padi4-/- mice. RNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct modulation of immune-related pathways in PAD-KO lymphoid organs. Human T cells express both PADs and, when exposed to either PAD2 or PAD4 inhibitors, displayed abrogation of Th1 polarization. These results suggest that targeting PAD2 and/or PAD4 activity modulates dysregulated TLR-7-dependent immune responses in lupus through differential effects of innate and adaptive immunity. Compounds that target PADs may have potential therapeutic roles in T cell-mediated diseases.</AbstractText> "

To build an OA-specific miRNA interactome, a prioritisation scheme was applied based on inverse Pearson's correlations and inverse DE of miRNAs and mRNAs.

We conducted the first integrative analysis of the fibrotic programming in these cells at the levels of gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression, as well as deposited ECM protein to gain insights into how fibrotic transcriptional programs culminate in aberrant ECM protein production/deposition. We identified messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNA, and deposited matrisome protein signatures for IPF and SSc fibroblasts obtained from lung transplants using next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry. SSc and IPF fibroblast transcriptional signatures were remarkably similar, with enrichment of WNT, TGF-β, and ECM genes. miRNA-seq identified differentially regulated miRNAs, including downregulation of miR-29b-3p, miR-138-5p and miR-146b-5p in disease fibroblasts and transfection of their mimics decreased expression of distinct sets of fibrotic signature genes as assessed using a Nanostring fibrosis panel. Finally, proteomic analyses uncovered a distinct &quot;fibrotic&quot; matrisome profile deposited by IPF and SSc fibroblasts compared to controls that highlights the dysregulated ECM production underlying their fibrogenic activities. Our comprehensive analyses of mRNA, miRNA, and matrisome proteomic profiles in IPF and SSc lung fibroblasts revealed robust fibrotic signatures at both the gene and protein expression levels and identified novel fibrogenesis-associated miRNAs whose aberrant downregulation in disease fibroblasts likely contributes to their fibrotic and ECM gene expression.</AbstractText> "

However, these findings were based on the identification of culturable bacteria and at times not below burial grounds. Investigation on the bacterial diversity and functional profiles of bacterial communities above and below burial grounds in human cemeteries are few. The current study used high-throughput sequencing techniques to determine the bacterial composition and their associated functional profiles in cemetery soil samples collected at the surface and below burial ground in two South African cemeteries (Maitland Cemetery in Cape Town and Fontein Street Cemetery in Middelburg) to evaluate the potential health threat to surrounding populations through contamination of groundwater. Significant differences were observed between sample depths with the clustering of the surface (0 m) and the 2 m samples into separate groups. Pseudomonas and Corynebacterium were the most abundant genera across all samples. Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus were the dominant genera in the 2 m samples while Prauserella and Staphylococcus were dominant in the surface samples. The 2 m samples showed a lower alpha diversity but recorded higher proportions of human diseases functional classes compared to the surface samples. Human disease functional profiles revealed involvement, in infectious (cholera), neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's disease) cardiovascular (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) immune system (Systemic lupus erythematosus) metabolic (Type I &amp; II diabetes) diseases and cancer. Antibiotic resistance and antibiotics synthesis signatures were also identified. Thus, cemeteries could be potential sources of microbial and antibiotic pollution in groundwater, especially in areas with shallow water tables such as Maitland. Selection of sites for use as cemeteries should, therefore, require a proper understanding of the hydrogeological characteristics of the selected site. However, further studies are required to trace the actual movement of these pollutants into groundwater resources.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, CC and CC-BS may downregulate OPRL1, consequently inhibiting production of the nociception receptor NOP, leading to pain relief. In neuroglia cells, CC and CC-BS inhibited signaling pathways related to opioids, neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid diseases. CC and CC-BS also downregulated ADAM metallopeptidase gene ADAMTS5 expression by 11.2-fold and 13.5-fold, respectively.

The latter further adds the value for compatibility with low input samples, optical imaging, scalability, and portability. However, cell lysis in microwells remains challenging despite the recently developed sophisticated solutions. Here, we present scFTD-seq, a microchip platform for performing single-cell freeze-thaw lysis directly toward 3' mRNA sequencing. It offers format flexibility with a simplified, widely adoptable workflow that reduces the number of preparation steps and hands-on time, with the quality of data and cost per sample matching that of the state-of-the-art scRNA-seq platforms. Freeze-thaw, known as an unfavorable lysis method resulting in possible RNA fragmentation, turns out to be fully compatible with 3' scRNA-seq. We applied it to the profiling of circulating follicular helper T cells implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis. Our results delineate the heterogeneity in the transcriptional programs and effector functions of these rare pathogenic T cells. As scFTD-seq decouples on-chip cell isolation and library preparation, we envision it to allow sampling at the distributed sites including point-of-care settings and downstream processing at centralized facilities, which should enable wide-spread adoption beyond academic laboratories.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2018.

However, the impact of ERVs on human health and disease is not well understood. While select ERVs have been implicated in diseases, including autoimmune disease and cancer, the lack of tools to analyze genome-wide, locus-specific expression of proviral autonomous ERVs has hampered the progress in the field. Here we describe a method called ERVmap, consisting of an annotated database of 3,220 human proviral ERVs and a pipeline that allows for locus-specific genome-wide identification of proviral ERVs that are transcribed based on RNA-sequencing data, and provide examples of the utility of this tool. Using ERVmap, we revealed cell-type-specific ERV expression patterns in commonly used cell lines as well as in primary cells. We identified 124 unique ERV loci that are significantly elevated in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus that represent an IFN-independent signature. Finally, we identified additional tumor-associated ERVs that correlate with cytolytic activity represented by granzyme and perforin expression in breast cancer tissue samples. The open-source code of ERVmap and the accompanied web tool are made publicly available to quantify proviral ERVs in RNA-sequencing data with ease. Use of ERVmap across a range of diseases and experimental conditions has the potential to uncover novel disease-associated antigens and effectors involved in human health that is currently missed by focusing on protein-coding sequences.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

To support the results of genetic mapping studies for CHD and its concomitant osteoarthritis with functional information, we performed RNA-seq on hip capsule and teres ligament of affected and unaffected dogs. RNA seq showed that expressed genes segregated according age, capsule or ligament, and hip phenotype. Expression of HHIP, DACT2, and WIF1 was significantly higher in capsule from control hips than dysplastic hips indicating a disruption of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Expression of SPON 1, a key component of the WNT pathway, was increased significantly in both dysplastic capsule and ligament while FBN2 and EMILIN3 were significantly increased in dysplastic capsule. Of genes associated with human hip osteoarthritis, expression of ACAN, IGF1, CILP2, COL11A1, COL8A1, and HAPLN was increased significantly in dysplastic capsule. The significant increase in expression of PLA2F, TNFRSF, TMEM, and IGFBP in dysplastic capsule indicated an injury response. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in extracellular matrix structure, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, myogenesis, growth factor signaling, cancer and immune pathways were enriched in dysplastic capsule. For teres ligament from dysplastic joints, genes in retinoic signaling pathways and those encoding extracellular matrix molecules, but not proteoglycans, were enriched. Hip tissues respond to abnormal mechanics early in dysplastic hip development and these pathways present targets for intervention in the early synovitis and capsulitis secondary to canine and human hip dysplasia. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Here, we integrate deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) information with drug prescription and ADE data from Estonian electronic health record (EHR) databases to evaluate genome- and pharmacome-wide associations on an unprecedented scale. We leveraged WGS data of 2240 Estonian Biobank participants and imputed all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with allele counts over 2 for 13,986 genotyped participants. Overall, we identified 41 (10 novel) loss-of-function and 567 (134 novel) missense variants in 64 very important pharmacogenes. The majority of the detected variants were very rare with frequencies below 0.05%, and 6 of the novel loss-of-function and 99 of the missense variants were only detected as single alleles (allele count = 1). We also validated documented pharmacogenetic associations and detected new independent variants in known gene-drug pairs. Specifically, we found that CTNNA3 was associated with myositis and myopathies among individuals taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory oxicams and replicated this finding in an extended cohort of 706 individuals.

In this prospective clinical study, nasal swabs were collected from patients with GPA, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, disease control), and healthy controls. Nasal bacterial taxa were assessed using V3-V4 region 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza, and entero- and rhinoviruses were detected using qPCR. Unbiased metagenomic RNA sequencing (UMERS) was performed in a subset of samples to determine the relative abundance of bacterial, fungal, and viral species. A trend toward reduced microbiome diversity was detected in GPA samples compared with healthy controls. The abundance of bacterial taxa and microbial richness were significantly decreased in GPA samples compared with RA samples. The relative abundance of bacterial families shifted, with increased Planococcaceae and decreased Moraxellaceae, Tissierellaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Propionibacteriaceae in GPA and RA. Further, decreased abundance of Corynebacteriaceae, and Aerococcaceae was observed in GPA samples. Significantly more colonization of S. aureus was seen in the nasal microbiome of GPA compared with RA and healthy control samples. H. influenzae colonization was also observed in GPA samples. UMERS detected the presence of rhinoviral sequences in some GPA samples. Thus, our study uncovered changes in the URT microbial composition in patients with GPA and RA, suggesting that both immunosuppression and disease background affect the URT microbiome.

LncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was constructed to predict the potential molecular regulatory mechanisms of specifically expressed lncRNAs in OA synovium. 384 mRNAs and 17 lncRNAs were detected to be differentially expressed in OA synovium. The expressions of 4 lncRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR. We found the differentially expression lncRNAs could potentially regulate OA progression through pathways regarding to immune response through the lncRNA-mRNA network and further annotation for co-expression mRNAs. Our results indicated that lncRNAs may play key roles in OA synovitis and may have potential value in OA diagnosis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

IL-17A blockade was performed in HLA-B27/human β<sub>2</sub> -microglobulin (hβ<sub>2</sub> m)-transgenic rats, which served as a model for SpA in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. Inflammation and new bone formation were evaluated by micro-computed tomography imaging, histologic analysis, and gene expression profiling.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">TNF and IL-17A significantly increased in vitro osteoblastic differentiation. In vivo, prophylactic blockade of IL-17A significantly delayed spondylitis and arthritis development and decreased arthritis severity. Anti-IL-17A treatment was also associated with prevention of bone loss and periosteal new bone formation. Therapeutic targeting of IL-17A after the initial inflammatory insult also significantly reduced axial and peripheral joint inflammation. This treatment was again associated with a marked reduction in spinal and peripheral structural damage, including new bone formation. RNA sequencing of target tissue confirmed that IL-17A is a key driver of the molecular signature of disease in this model and that therapeutic anti-IL-17A treatment reversed the inflammatory signature and the selected gene expression related to bone damage.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Both prophylactic and therapeutic inhibition of IL-17A diminished inflammation and new bone formation in HLA-B27/hβ<sub>2</sub> m-transgenic rats.

PBMCs from SLE patients and healthy individuals were depleted of monocytes. Cells were stimulated with RNA-containing IC (RNA-IC) in the presence or absence of IRAK4i I92 or HCQ, and cytokines were measured by immunoassay or flow cytometry. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on RNA-IC-stimulated pDCs from healthy individuals to assess the effect of IRAK4i and HCQ.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">In healthy individuals, RNA-IC induced interferon (IFN)-α, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)1-α, and MIP1-β production in pDC and NK cell cocultures. IFN-α production was selective for pDCs, whereas both pDCs and NK cells produced TNF-α. IRAK4i reduced the pDC and NK cell-derived cytokine production by 74-95%. HCQ interfered with cytokine production in pDCs but not in NK cells. In monocyte-depleted PBMCs, IRAK4i blocked cytokine production more efficiently than HCQ. Following RNA-IC activation of pDCs, 975 differentially expressed genes were observed (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05), with many connected to cytokine pathways, cell regulation, and apoptosis. IRAK4i altered the expression of a larger number of RNA-IC-induced genes than did HCQ (492 versus 65 genes).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The IRAK4i I92 exhibits a broader inhibitory effect than HCQ on proinflammatory pathways triggered by RNA-IC, suggesting IRAK4 inhibition as a therapeutic option in SLE.</AbstractText> "

While genetic and transcriptomic analyses have revealed some genes and non-coding loci associated to OA, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Chromatin profiling, which provides insight into gene regulation, has not been reported in OA mainly due to technical difficulties. Here, we employed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map the accessible chromatin landscape in articular knee cartilage of OA patients. We identified 109,215 accessible chromatin regions for cartilages, of which 71% were annotated as enhancers. By overlaying them with genetic and DNA methylation data, we have determined potential OA-relevant enhancers and their putative target genes. Furthermore, through integration with RNA-seq data, we characterized genes that are altered both at epigenomic and transcriptomic levels in OA. These genes are enriched in pathways regulating ossification and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Consistently, the differentially accessible regions in OA are enriched for MSC-specific enhancers and motifs of transcription factor families involved in osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion, we demonstrate how direct chromatin profiling of clinical tissues can provide comprehensive epigenetic information for a disease and suggest candidate genes and enhancers of translational potential.</AbstractText> "

Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. <b>Methods:</b> We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. <b>Results:</b> By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, <i>HSPG2</i> and <i>APLNR</i>, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. <b>Conclusion:</b> ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC injury in SSc.</AbstractText> "

We conducted whole-genome sequencing on multiplex Japanese families with atypical psychosis. The patient group of interest shows acute psychotic features including hallucinations, delusions, and catatonic symptoms while they often show good prognosis after the onset. In addition to the next-generation analysis, HLA typing has been conveyed to check the similarity with autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Shared causal polymorphisms in the Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma, Netrin 1 receptor (DCC) gene were found in one multiplex family with three patients, and variants in the RNA 3'-Terminal Phosphate Cyclase (RTCA) and One Cut Homeobox 2 (ONECUT2) genes were found to be shared in seven patients. Next-generation sequencing analysis of the MHC region (previously suggested to be a hot region in atypical psychosis) using HLA typing (HLA-DRB1) revealed a common vulnerability with SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) among five patients. This finding demonstrates the shared etiology between psychotic symptoms and autoimmune diseases at the genetic level. Focusing on a specific clinical phenotype is key for elucidating the genetic factors that underlie the complex traits of psychosis.</AbstractText> "

"366";"30319641";"Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Is Dependent on Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling.";" <AbstractText>About 40% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus experience diffuse neuropsychiatric manifestations, including impaired cognition and depression. Although the pathogenesis of diffuse neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) is not fully understood, loss of brain barrier integrity, autoreactive antibodies, and pro-inflammatory cytokines are major contributors to disease development. Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, prevents lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs through functional antagonism of S1P receptors. In addition to reducing the circulation of autoreactive lymphocytes, fingolimod has direct neuroprotective effects such as preserving brain barrier integrity and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by astrocytes and microglia. Given these effects, we hypothesized that fingolimod would attenuate neurobehavioral deficits in MRL-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice, a validated neuropsychiatric lupus model. Fingolimod treatment was initiated after the onset of disease, and mice were assessed for alterations in cognitive function and emotionality. We found that fingolimod significantly attenuated spatial memory deficits and depression-like behavior in MRL/lpr mice. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated a dramatic lessening of brain T cell and macrophage infiltration, and a significant reduction in cortical leakage of serum albumin, in fingolimod treated mice. Astrocytes and endothelial cells from treated mice exhibited reduced expression of inflammatory genes, while microglia showed differential regulation of key immune pathways. Notably, cytokine levels within the cortex and hippocampus were not appreciably decreased with fingolimod despite the improved neurobehavioral profile. Furthermore, despite a reduction in splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and circulating autoantibody titers, IgG deposition within the brain was unaffected by treatment. These findings suggest that fingolimod mediates attenuation of NPSLE through a mechanism that is not dependent on reduction of autoantibodies or cytokines, and highlight modulation of the S1P signaling pathway as a novel therapeutic target in lupus involving the central nervous system.</AbstractText> "

Previous GWAS identified common variants with modest effects on serum urate. Here we report large-scale whole-exome sequencing association studies of serum urate and kidney function among ≤19,517 European ancestry and African-American individuals. We identify aggregate associations of low-frequency damaging variants in the urate transporters SLC22A12 (URAT1; p = 1.3 × 10<sup>-56</sup>) and SLC2A9 (p = 4.5 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Gout risk in rare SLC22A12 variant carriers is halved (OR = 0.5, p = 4.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). Selected rare variants in SLC22A12 are validated in transport studies, confirming three as loss-of-function (R325W, R405C, and T467M) and illustrating the therapeutic potential of the new URAT1-blocker lesinurad. In SLC2A9, mapping of rare variants of large effects onto the predicted protein structure reveals new residues that may affect urate binding. These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of serum urate, and highlight molecular targets in SLC22A12 and SLC2A9 for lowering serum urate and preventing gout.</AbstractText> "

The study focused on a 67-year-old woman who presented with a 40-year history of familial endometriosis associated with various non-gynecological co-morbidities, thus representing a unique case from a cohort of 1,000 patients with endometriosis. Her family history included infertile members suffering from endometriosis. Thirteen non-gynecological co-morbidities were documented throughout the years, including five autoimmune diseases (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, bronchial asthma and Crohn's disease), urinary bladder diverticulum, osteoporosis, multinodular goiter, cardiovascular diseases, gastroesophageal reflux disease, malignant tumor of urinary bladder, Barrett's esophagus and bilateral cataract. In order to understand the potential role of gene mutations in the development of all those co-morbidities, whole exome sequencing was performed and the presence of various disease-associated, potentially causal missense variants, were observed. These findings are in accordance with the previously suggested common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, autoimmune disorders. This unusual case provides novel insights demonstrating that endometriosis can coexist with various chronic autoimmune diseases and other conditions, including non-gynecological malignancies, which possibly share a common genetic cause, a fact that should be taken into consideration seriously by clinicians.</AbstractText> "

PKCδ has a role in the negative regulation of B cells. Given the nature of the disease, a logical targeted therapeutic approach in these patients is B cell depletion. Indeed, the 3 siblings all had a marked clinical response and resolution of symptoms with rituximab, although 2 of the siblings had severe reactions to rituximab thus precluding further treatment with this. We therefore describe the first successful use of ofatumumab for this rare form of monogenic SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">All three affected siblings presented with SLE before the age of 3-years with lethargy, intermittent fever, thrombocytopenia, cutaneous involvement, alopecia, and hepatosplenomegaly.

Homozygosity mapping followed by whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation in PRKCD (p.Gly432Trp), subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing to be present in all 3 siblings. All 3 patients were initially treated with rituximab, however 2 of the siblings developed severe infusion-related reactions. For subsequent disease flare in these individuals we therefore used an alternative B cell depleting agent, ofatumumab (300 mg/1.73m<sup>2</sup> on day 1; 700 mg/1.73m<sup>2</sup> on day 15).

Current implant design permits long-term survivorship of THAs, but certain metal-on-metal (MoM) articulations can portend catastrophic failure due to adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR). Here, we identified biological and molecular differences between periacetabular synovial tissues of patients with MoM THA failure undergoing revision THA compared to patients undergoing primary THA for routine osteoarthritis (OA). Analysis of tissue biopsies by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that MoM patient samples exhibit significantly increased expression of immune response genes but decreased expression of genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Thus, interplay between local tissue inflammation and ECM degradation may account for the pathology and compromised clinical outcomes in select patients with MoM implants. We conclude that adverse responses of host tissues to implant materials result in transcriptomic modifications in patients with MoM implants that permit consideration of strategies that could mitigate ECM damage.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Recent studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs participate in the regulation of antiviral responses and autoimmune disease. Despite their emerging role as immune mediators, the mechanisms that govern lncRNA expression and function have only begun to be characterized. In this study, we explore the role of lncRNAs in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are critical sentinel sensors of viral infection and contribute to the development of autoimmune disease. Using genome-wide sequencing approaches, we dissect the contributions of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and type I interferon (IFN-I) in the regulation of coding and noncoding RNA expression in CAL-1 pDCs treated with R848 or IFNβ. Functional enrichment analysis reveals both the unique and synergistic roles of TLR7 and IFN-I signaling in the orchestration of pDC function. These observations were consistent with primary cell immune responses elicited by detection of viral infection. We identified and characterized the conditional TLR7- and IFN-I-dependent regulation of 588 lncRNAs. Dysregulation of these lncRNAs could significantly alter pDC maturation, IFN-I and inflammatory cytokine production, antigen presentation, costimulation or tolerance cues, turnover, or localization, all consequential events during viral infection or IFN-I-driven autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings demonstrate the differential responsiveness of lncRNAs to unique immune stimuli, uncover regulatory mechanisms of lncRNA expression, and reveal a novel and tractable platform for the study of lncRNA expression and function.</AbstractText> "

The main characteristic of both diseases is uncontrolled differentiation of B cells into plasmablast/plasma cells. Despite continuous research on prognostic factors and the introduction of new agents for MM and SLE, treatments still do not exist for controlling plasmablast/plasma cells. Thus, it is necessary to identify novel therapeutic targets of plasmablast/plasma cells. Because of its plasmablast-like characteristics, the mus musculus myeloma SP 2/0 cell line was used in this study to test the effect of a novel therapeutic agent (BC094916 overexpression) on plasmablast/plasma cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Methods"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">We first determined gene expression profiles of plasma cells using Affymetrix microarrays and RNA-sequencing. The effect of BC094916 on SP 2/0 cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis was determined by CCK8 and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The SP 2/0 xenograft mouse model was used to assess the impact of BC094916 on tumor progression. The luciferase reporter system was used to evaluate the effect of BC094916 on Creb1 and Bcl2 transcription.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">We found that BC094916 mRNA was decreased in plasma cells. The mouse myeloma cell line SP 2/0 expressed low levels of BC094916 mRNA, whereas BC094916 overexpression suppressed SP 2/0 cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis. BC094916 overexpression suppressed tumor progression in the SP 2/0 xenograft mouse model. We also found that BC094916 mediate apoptosis by suppressing transcription of the Creb1 and Bcl2 genes, which promote the transcription of eukaryotic translation initiation and elongation factor genes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">BC094916 overexpression suppressed Creb1 and Bcl2 transcription to induce cell apoptosis, which suppressed SP 2/0 proliferation and xenograft tumor progression. Thus, BC094916 overexpression may be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of MM and autoimmune diseases such as SLE.</AbstractText> "

However, despite spirochetal killing, some patients develop proliferative synovitis, characterised by synovial hyperplasia, inflammation, vascular damage, and fibrosis that persists for months to several years after antibiotic treatment, called postinfectious LA. In this study, we characterised the transcriptomes of postinfectious LA patients' synovial tissue, the target tissue of the immune response. High-throughput RNA sequencing to a depth of ~30 million reads per sample was used to profile gene expression in synovial tissue from 14 patients with postinfectious LA, compared with eight patients with other types of chronic inflammatory arthritis and five with minimally inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA). Synovium from postinfectious LA and other inflammatory arthritides shared gene signatures associated with antigen presentation, innate immune responses, and cell-mediated immune activation, whereas these responses were diminished in OA synovium. Unique to postinfectious LA was a particularly robust interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signature. Moreover, this heightened IFNγ signature inversely correlated with expression of genes involved in repair of damaged tissue, including genes associated with stromal cell proliferation and differentiation, neovascularisation, and extracellular matrix synthesis, which were markedly suppressed in postinfectious LA. Transcriptional observations were confirmed by cytokine profiling, histologic analyses, and clinical correlations. We propose that in patients with postinfectious LA, overexpression of IFNγ in synovium prevents appropriate repair of tissue damaged by B. burgdorferi infection, blocking return to tissue homeostasis long after completion of antibiotic therapy and resolution of active infection.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.</CopyrightInformation> "

Diagnosis of KS was established after whole exome sequencing (WES) and detection of de novo frameshift 1bp deletion in histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D gene (KMT2D). The pathogenic variant in exon 34 (c.8626delC: 55 reads C, 56 reads delC), has not been described previously and is predicted to truncate the protein (p.Gln2876Serfs*34) resulting in KMT2D loss of function. Notwithstanding that patients with KS have a substantial susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an SLE and KS association. The exact relationship between the two conditions in our patient is difficult to determine with certainty, as a number of clinical features, including positive antiphospholipid antibodies, persistent hypogammaglobulinemia and the episode of convulsions may occur in both conditions, suggesting potential overlap of KS and SLE. The combination of a high susceptibility towards infections and an autoimmune disorder present a great challenge when trying to achieve the optimum therapy which will enable the patient to stay on the thin line of remission. This case report emphasizes the value of WES as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of rare disorders and/or unusual disease presentations of possible genetic cause.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind PTOA development following ACL injury, we profiled ACL injury-induced transcriptional changes in knee joints of three mouse strains with varying susceptibility to OA: STR/ort (highly susceptible), C57BL/6J (moderately susceptible) and super-healer MRL/MpJ (not susceptible). Right knee joints of the mice were injured using a non-invasive tibial compression injury model and global gene expression was quantified before and at 1-day, 1-week, and 2-weeks post-injury using RNA-seq. Following injury, injured and uninjured joints of STR/ort and injured C57BL/6J joints displayed significant cartilage degeneration while MRL/MpJ had little cartilage damage. Gene expression analysis suggested that prolonged inflammation and elevated catabolic activity in STR/ort injured joints, compared to the other two strains may be responsible for the severe PTOA phenotype observed in this strain. MRL/MpJ had the lowest expression values for several inflammatory cytokines and catabolic enzymes activated in response to ACL injury. Furthermore, we identified several genes highly expressed in MRL/MpJ compared to the other two strains including <i>B4galnt2</i> and <i>Tpsab1</i> which may contribute to enhanced healing in the MRL/MpJ. Overall, this study has increased our knowledge of early molecular changes associated with PTOA development.</AbstractText> "

We asked whether the profound B cell loss in belimumab-treated SLE patients is accompanied by shifts in the immunoglobulin repertoire. We enrolled 15 patients who had been continuously treated with belimumab for more than 7 years, 17 matched controls, and 5 patients who were studied before and after drug initiation. VH genes of sort-purified mature B cells and plasmablasts were subjected to next-generation sequencing. We found that B cell-activating factor (BAFF) regulates the transitional B cell checkpoint, with conservation of transitional 1 (T1) cells and approximately 90% loss of T3 and naive B cells after chronic belimumab treatment. Class-switched memory B cells, B1 B cells, and plasmablasts were also substantially depleted. Next-generation sequencing revealed no redistribution of VH, DH, or JH family usage and no effect of belimumab on representation of the autoreactive VH4-34 gene or CDR3 composition in unmutated IgM sequences, suggesting a minimal effect on selection of the naive B cell repertoire. Interestingly, a significantly greater loss of VH4-34 was observed among mutated IgM and plasmablast sequences in chronic belimumab-treated subjects than in controls, suggesting that belimumab promotes negative selection of activated autoreactive B cells.</AbstractText> "

In PM, a major component of inflammatory cell infiltrates is CD8+ T cells, whereas in DM, CD4+ T cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and B cells predominate. In this study, with the aim to differentiate involvement of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subpopulations in myositis subgroups, we investigated transcriptomic profiles of T cells from peripheral blood of patients with myositis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Total RNA was extracted from CD4+ T cells (PM = 8 and DM = 7) and CD8+ T cells (PM = 4 and DM = 5) that were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells via positive selection using microbeads. Sequencing libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, yielding about 50 million paired-end reads per sample. Differential gene expression analyses were conducted using DESeq2.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In CD4+ T cells, only two genes, ANKRD55 and S100B, were expressed significantly higher in patients with PM than in patients with DM (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05, model adjusted for age, sex, HLA-DRB1*03 status, and RNA integrity number [RIN]). On the contrary, in CD8+ T cells, 176 genes were differentially expressed in patients with PM compared with patients with DM. Of these, 44 genes were expressed significantly higher in CD8+ T cells from patients with PM, and 132 genes were expressed significantly higher in CD8+ T cells from patients with DM (FDR &lt; 0.05, model adjusted for age, sex, and RIN). Gene Ontology analysis showed that genes differentially expressed in CD8+ T cells are involved in lymphocyte migration and regulation of T-cell differentiation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our data strongly suggest that CD8+ T cells represent a major divergence between PM and DM patients compared with CD4+ T cells. These alterations in the gene expression in T cells from PM and DM patients might advocate for distinct immune mechanisms in these subphenotypes of myositis.</AbstractText> "

It is a multifactorial disorder with a significant genetic component. The heritability of OA has been estimated to be 60% for hip OA and 39% for knee OA. Genetic factors behind OA are still largely unknown. Studying families with strong history of OA, facilitates examining the co-segregation of genetic variation and OA. The aim of this study was to identify new, rare genetic factors and novel candidate genes for OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Eight patients from three Finnish families with hip and knee OA were studied using whole exome sequencing. We focused on rare exonic variants with predicted pathogenicity and variants located in active promoter or strong enhancer regions. Expression of identified candidate genes were studied in bone and cartilage tissues and the observed variants were investigated using bioinformatic analyses.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Two rare variants co-segregated with OA in two families. In Family 8 a missense variant (c.628C&gt;G, p.Arg210Gly) was observed in the OLIG3 gene that encodes a transcription factor known to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory polyarthritis. The Arg210Gly variant was estimated to be pathogenic by Polyphen-2 and Mutation taster and the locus is conserved among mammals. In Family 12 the observed variant (c.-127G&gt;T) was located in the transcription start site of the FIP1L1 gene. FIP1L1 participates in the regulation of polyadenylation. The c.-127G&gt;T is located in the transcription start site and may alter the DNA-binding of transcription factors. Both, OLIG3 and FIP1L1 were observed in human bone and cartilage.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The identified variants revealed novel candidate genes for OA. OLIG3 and FIP1L1 have specific roles in transcription and may effect expression of other genes. Identified variants in these genes may thus have a role in the regulatory events leading to OA.</AbstractText> "

The mechanisms driving the activation of the interferon pathway in SLE have been the subject of intense investigation but are still incompletely understood. Transposable elements represent an enormous source of RNA that could potentially stimulate the cell intrinsic RNA-recognition pathway, leading to upregulation of interferons. We used RNA-seq to define transposable element families and subfamilies in three cell types in SLE and found diverse effects on transposable element expression in the three cell types and even within a given family of transposable elements. When potential mechanisms were examined, we found that Hsp90 inhibition could drive increased expression of multiple type of transposable elements. Both direct inhibition and the delivery of a heat shock itself, which redirects heat shock regulators (including Hsp90) off of basal expression promoters and onto heat shock-responsive promoters, led to increased transposable element expression. This effect was amplified by the concurrent delivery of a histone deacetylase inhibitor. We conclude that transposable elements are dysregulated in SLE and there are tissue-specific effects and locus-specific effects. The magnitude of RNAs attributable to transposable elements makes their dysregulation of critical interest in SLE where transposable element RNA complexed with proteins has been shown to drive interferon expression.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Joint damage was assessed by histology. RNA-sequencing and pathway analyses were applied to synovial LECs. Macrophage subsets in the mouse synovium were identified by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining.

However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed comprehensive data integration of many large and publicly available datasets to combine information on autoimmune disease risk loci with RNA-Seq-based microRNA expression data. Specifically, we carried out microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping) to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering microRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn's disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p<sub>rs102275</sub> = 1.44e-20, p<sub>rs968567</sub> = 2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p = 5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both microRNAs (all with p &lt; 0.05).

Whole-genome sequencing studies of M28 GAS strains recovered from patients with invasive infections found an unexpectedly high number of missense (amino acid-changing) and nonsense (protein-truncating) polymorphisms in <i>rocA</i> (<u>r</u>egulator <u>o</u>f <u>C</u>ov), leading us to hypothesize that altered RocA activity contributes to M28 GAS molecular pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, an isogenic <i>rocA</i> deletion mutant strain was created. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that RocA inactivation significantly alters the level of transcripts for 427 and 323 genes at mid-exponential and early stationary growth phases, respectively, including genes for 41 transcription regulators and 21 virulence factors. In contrast, RocA transcriptomes from other GAS M protein serotypes are much smaller and include fewer transcription regulators. The <i>rocA</i> mutant strain had significantly increased secreted activity of multiple virulence factors and grew to significantly higher colony counts under acid stress <i>in vitro</i> RocA inactivation also significantly increased GAS virulence in a mouse model of necrotizing myositis.

Intercellular communication containing synovial fibroblasts seems to play a major role in RA pathogenesis. In this study, to better understand intercellular communication related to RA pathogenesis, we identified exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from synovial fibroblasts. Exosomes were collected from an RA synovial fibroblast (RASF) cell line, namely, MH7A, with or without stimulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). We used small RNA sequencing to analyze the profile of small RNAs, including miRNAs, in MH7A exosomes and cells. By using differential expression analysis, we identified four miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-323a-5p, and miR-1307-3p) that are upregulated in exosomes with TNF-α stimulation. The identification of miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p which have been reported in RA patients demonstrated the validity of our experimental model. Other two miRNAs were newly identified. miR-323a-5p was predicted to target the protein encoding gene CD6, which attenuates T-cell activation signals, and miR-1307-3p was predicted to target the protein encoding gene N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2), which inhibits osteoclast-related gene expression.

Deep RNA sequencing was performed and pathway analysis of differentially expressed transcripts was done using Ingenuity®. A subset of differentially expressed genes in diabetic gastroparesis was validated in a separate cohort using QT-PCR.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">111 genes were differentially expressed in diabetic gastroparesis and 181 in idiopathic gastroparesis with a log<sub>2</sub>fold difference of | ≥ 2| and false detection rate (FDR) &lt; 5%. Top canonical pathways in diabetic gastroparesis included genes involved with macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis pathway and differential regulation of cytokine production in macrophages and T helper cells by IL-17A and IL-17F. Top canonical pathways in idiopathic gastroparesis included genes involved in granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Sixty-five differentially expressed genes (log<sub>2</sub>fold difference | ≥ 2|, FDR &lt; 5%) were common in both diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis with genes in the top 5 canonical pathways associated with immune signaling. 4/5 highly differentially expressed genes (SGK1, APOLD1, CXCR4, CXCL2, and FOS) in diabetic gastroparesis were validated in a separate cohort of patients using RT-PCR. Immune profile analysis revealed that genes associated with M1 (pro inflammatory) macrophages were enriched in tissues from idiopathic gastroparesis tissues compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis have both unique and overlapping transcriptomic signatures.

There have been hardly any cases reported in the Chinese population. We aimed to describe the first cohort of adult FMF patients in China.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Methods"">We evaluated all the adult patients suffering from FMF referred to our centre from April 2015 through March 2017. Patients were diagnosed clinically according to the Tel Hashomer criteria. Whole exome sequencing was performed in each patient.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"">A total of 11 adult patients were diagnosed as FMF in our centre. The mean age of onset was 29.4 years (s.d. 18.2). All patients were of Chinese Han ethnicity with no positive family history. All patients had intermittent febrile episodes. During attacks, seven patients had generalized abdominal pain, three experienced chest pain, four developed arthritis and none reported erysipelas-like skin changes. No patient had evidence of AA amyloidosis. Every patient carried at least one variant in the MEFV gene. All patients had good response to colchicine.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"">Our study is the first to suggest the presence of FMF in the Chinese adult population. The late onset, often atypical and mild clinical manifestations and absence of AA amyloidosis in our patients might be related to low-penetrance and heterozygous MEFV variants. Our results await to be confirmed on larger Chinese populations.</AbstractText> "

As disease-modifying therapies are not available, novel therapeutic targets need to be discovered and prioritized for their importance in mediating the abnormal phenotype of cells in OA-affected joints. Here, we generated a genome-wide molecular profile of OA to elucidate regulatory mechanisms of OA pathogenesis and to identify possible therapeutic targets using integrative analysis of mRNA-sequencing data obtained from human knee cartilage.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""DESIGN"">RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 18 normal and 20 OA human knee cartilage tissues. RNA-seq datasets were analysed to identify genes, pathways and regulatory networks that were dysregulated in OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">RNA-seq data analysis revealed 1332 differentially expressed (DE) genes between OA and non-OA samples, including known and novel transcription factors (TFs). Pathway analysis identified 15 significantly perturbed pathways in OA with ECM-related, PI3K-Akt, HIF-1, FoxO and circadian rhythm pathways being the most significantly dysregulated. We selected DE TFs that are enriched for regulating DE genes in OA and prioritized these TFs by creating a cartilage-specific interaction subnetwork. This analysis revealed eight TFs, including JUN, Early growth response (EGR)1, JUND, FOSL2, MYC, KLF4, RELA, and FOS that both target large numbers of dysregulated genes in OA and are themselves suppressed in OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We identified a novel subnetwork of dysregulated TFs that represent new mediators of abnormal gene expression and promising therapeutic targets in OA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018.

Our objective was to study the occurrence, phylogenetic relationships and antimicrobial resistance properties of MRSA isolated from ocular surfaces of horses prior to invasive procedures. Within a 49-week sampling period, ocular swabs obtained from 46 eyes of 44 horses, including eyes with clinical signs of conjunctivitis/blepharitis, keratitis or uveitis were screened for the presence of S. aureus. As a result, seven samples were positive for S. aureus (15.2%), with six of them being classified as MRSA (13%). In addition, all isolates were resistant or showed reduced susceptibility to tetracyclines, the aminoglycosides gentamicin and kanamycin, fluoroquinolones, and the combination sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Since a very close relationship between the MRSA isolates was assumed after pulsed-field gel electrophoresis employing the restriction endonuclease ApaI, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to shed more light on the phylogenetic relationships and the molecular composition of all MRSA isolates. Analysis of WGS data revealed closely related MRSA belonging to sequence type 398, spa type t011 and dru type dt10q, harboring an SCCmec IV element and the Staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity island SaPIbov5. Moreover, all MRSA were positive for a beta-hemolysin converting phage carrying genes of the immune evasion cluster (IEC). Since cases of eye infections due to MRSA were often associated with fatal outcomes, more research is needed with respect to the origin of MRSA isolated from ocular surfaces to implement sufficient barrier and infection control measures.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018.

"397";"30077426";"Molecular mechanisms of autophagic memory in pathogenic T cells in human arthritis.";" <AbstractText>T-cell resilience is critical to the immune pathogenesis of human autoimmune arthritis. Autophagy is essential for memory T cell generation and associated with pathogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our aim here was to delineate the role and molecular mechanism of autophagy in resilience and persistence of pathogenic T cells from autoimmune arthritis. We demonstrated &quot;Autophagic memory&quot; as elevated autophagy levels in CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells and in Jurkat Human T cell line trained with starvation stress. We then showed increased levels of autophagy in pathogenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells subsets from autoimmune arthritis patients. Using RNA-sequencing, transcription factor gene regulatory network and methylation analyses we identified MYC as a key regulator of autophagic memory. We validated MYC levels using qPCR and further demonstrated that inhibiting MYC increased autophagy. The present study proposes the novel concept of autophagic memory and suggests that autophagic memory confers metabolic advantage to pathogenic T cells from arthritis and supports its resilience and long term survival. Particularly, suppression of MYC imparted the heightened autophagy levels in pathogenic T cells. These studies have a direct translational valency as they identify autophagy and its metabolic controllers as a novel therapeutic target.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018.

However, we do not know whether risk for inflammatory disease predisposes unaffected individuals to late-life cognitive deficits or AD-related neuropathology. We investigated whether genetic risk scores for seven immune diseases and central nervous system traits were related to cognitive decline (n<sub>max</sub> = 1601), classical AD neuropathology (n<sub>max</sub> = 985), or microglial density (n<sub>max</sub> = 184).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Longitudinal cognitive decline, postmortem amyloid and tau neuropathology, microglial density, and gene module expression from bulk brain tissue were all measured in participants from two large cohorts (the Rush Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; ROS/MAP) of elderly subjects (mean age at entry 78 +/- 8.7 years). We analyzed data primarily using robust regression methods. Neuropathologists were blind to clinical data.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The AD genetic risk scores, including and excluding APOE effects, were strongly associated with cognitive decline in all domains (min P<sub>uncor</sub> = 3.2 × 10<sup>- 29</sup>). Multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia risk did not influence cognitive decline in older age, but the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk score alone was significantly associated with microglial density after correction (t<sub>146</sub> = - 3.88, P<sub>uncor</sub> = 1.6 × 10<sup>- 4</sup>). Post-hoc tests found significant effects of the RA genetic risk score in multiple regions and stages of microglial activation (min P<sub>uncor</sub> = 1.5 × 10<sup>- 6</sup>). However, these associations were driven by only one or two variants, rather than cumulative polygenicity. Further, individual MS (P<sub>one-sided</sub> &lt; 8.4 × 10<sup>- 4</sup>) and RA (P<sub>one-sided</sub> = 3 × 10<sup>- 4</sup>) variants associated with higher microglial density were also associated with increased expression of brain immune gene modules.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results demonstrate that global risk of inflammatory disease does not strongly influence aging-related cognitive decline but that susceptibility variants that influence peripheral immune function also alter microglial density and immune gene expression in the aging brain, opening a new perspective on the control of microglial and immune responses within the central nervous system. Further study on the molecular mechanisms of peripheral immune disease risk influencing glial cell activation will be required to identify key regulators of these pathways.</AbstractText> "

Luciferase assay was used to model IFNβ and NF-κB activity <i>in vitro</i>.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">WGS revealed a <i>de novo</i> mutation p.Arg284Ser in STING at an amino acid previously associated with SAVI. Although this mutation did not fall in the dimerization domain (DD), mRNA analysis revealed constitutive IFN-gene activation consistent with an interferonopathy, which correlated to STING activation <i>in vitro</i>. The patient was treated with corticosteroids and the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib, resulting in a rapid improvement of pulmonary hypertension, general well-being, and resolution of the IFN gene signature. However, he did go on to evolve a nasal septal erosion suggesting incomplete control of disease.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">This case provides molecular evidence to support the p.Arg284Ser variant in STING exerting pathogenicity through a gain-of-function mechanism. The lack of cutaneous vasculitis or elevated systemic inflammatory markers, and the occurrence of an opportunistic infection are notable, and raise the possibility that variants outside the STING DD may potentially manifest with an atypical SAVI phenotype. Nevertheless, there was an objective clinical improvement in response to JAK inhibition.</AbstractText> "

It is one of the few true ophthalmic emergencies but symptoms and signs are variable thereby making it a challenging disease to diagnose. A temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard to confirm GCA, but there are currently no specific biochemical markers to aid diagnosis. We aimed to identify a less invasive method to confirm the diagnosis of GCA, as well as to ascertain clinically relevant predictive biomarkers by studying the transcriptome of purified peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in patients with GCA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We recruited 16 patients with histological evidence of GCA at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, and aimed to collect blood samples at six time points: acute phase, 2-3 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after clinical diagnosis. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were positively selected at each time point through magnetic-assisted cell sorting. RNA was extracted from all 195 collected samples for subsequent RNA sequencing.

Here we investigate the role of interferon kappa (IFN-κ) in regulation of type I interferon (IFN) and photosensitive responses and examine its dysregulation in lupus skin.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">mRNA expression of type I IFN genes was analysed from microarray data of CLE lesions and healthy control skin. Similar expression in cultured primary keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells was analysed via RNA-seq. <i>IFNK</i> knock-out (KO) keratinocytes were generated using CRISPR/Cas9. Keratinocytes stably overexpressing IFN-κ were created via G418 selection of transfected cells. IFN responses were assessed via phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and qRT-PCR for IFN-regulated genes. Ultraviolet B-mediated apoptosis was analysed via TUNEL staining. In vivo protein expression was assessed via immunofluorescent staining of normal and CLE lesional skin.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS""><i>IFNK</i> is one of two type I IFNs significantly increased (1.5-fold change, false discovery rate (FDR) q&lt;0.001) in lesional CLE skin. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that type I IFN responses were enriched (FDR=6.8×10<sup>-04</sup>) in keratinocytes not in fibroblast and endothelial cells, and this epithelial-derived IFN-κ is responsible for maintaining baseline type I IFN responses in healthy skin. Increased levels of IFN-κ, such as seen in SLE, amplify and accelerate responsiveness of epithelia to IFN-α and increase keratinocyte sensitivity to UV irradiation. Notably, KO of IFN-κ or inhibition of IFN signalling with baricitinib abrogates UVB-induced apoptosis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Collectively, our data identify IFN-κ as a critical IFN in CLE pathology via promotion of enhanced IFN responses and photosensitivity.

"404";"29997562";"The Diagnostic Value of MRI Pattern Recognition in Distal Myopathies.";" <AbstractText><b>Objective:</b> Distal myopathies are a diagnostically challenging group of diseases. We wanted to understand the value of MRI in the current clinical setting and explore the potential for optimizing its clinical application. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively audited the diagnostic workup in a distal myopathy patient cohort, reassessing the diagnosis, whilst documenting the usage of MRI. We established a literature based distal myopathies MRI pattern template and assessed its diagnostic utility in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and potential impact on the diagnostic workup. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-five patients were included; in 38 with a comprehensive set of data the diagnostic work-up was audited. The median time from symptoms onset to diagnosis was 12.1 years. The initial genetic diagnostic rate was 39%; 18% were misdiagnosed as neuropathies and 13% as inclusion body myositis (IBM). Based on 21 publications we established a MRI pattern template. Its overall sensitivity (50%) and specificity (32%) were low. However in some diseases (e.g., <i>MYOT</i>-related myopathy, <i>TTN</i>-HMERF) MRI correctly identified the causative gene. The number of genes suggested by MRI pattern analysis was smaller compared to clinical work up (median 1 vs. 9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) but fewer genes were correctly predicted (5/10 vs. 7/10). MRI analysis ruled out IBM in all cases. <b>Conclusion:</b> In the diagnostic work-up of distal myopathies, MRI is useful in assisting genetic testing and avoiding misdiagnosis (IBM). The overall low sensitivity and specificity limits its generalized use when traditional single gene test methods are applied. However, in the context of next generation sequencing MRI may represent a valuable tool for interpreting complex genetic results.</AbstractText> "

The Accelerating Medicines Partnership RA/SLE Network aims to deconstruct autoimmune pathology by examining cells within target tissues through multiple high-dimensional assays. Robust standardized protocols need to be developed before cellular phenotypes at a single cell level can be effectively compared across patient samples.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Multiple clinical sites collected cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments from arthroplasty and synovial biopsy in a 10% DMSO solution. Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation parameters were optimized for viable cell extraction and surface protein preservation for cell sorting and mass cytometry, as well as for reproducibility in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cryopreserved synovial samples were collectively analyzed at a central processing site by a custom-designed and validated 35-marker mass cytometry panel. In parallel, each sample was flow sorted into fibroblast, T-cell, B-cell, and macrophage suspensions for bulk population RNA-seq and plate-based single-cell CEL-Seq2 RNA-seq.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Upon dissociation, cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments yielded a high frequency of viable cells, comparable to samples undergoing immediate processing. Optimization of synovial tissue dissociation across six clinical collection sites with ~ 30 arthroplasty and ~ 20 biopsy samples yielded a consensus digestion protocol using 100 μg/ml of Liberase™ TL enzyme preparation. This protocol yielded immune and stromal cell lineages with preserved surface markers and minimized variability across replicate RNA-seq transcriptomes. Mass cytometry analysis of cells from cryopreserved synovium distinguished diverse fibroblast phenotypes, distinct populations of memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells, and multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation states. Bulk RNA-seq of sorted cell populations demonstrated robust separation of synovial lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Single-cell RNA-seq produced transcriptomes of over 1000 genes/cell, including transcripts encoding characteristic lineage markers identified.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We have established a robust protocol to acquire viable cells from cryopreserved synovial tissue with intact transcriptomes and cell surface phenotypes. A centralized pipeline to generate multiple high-dimensional analyses of synovial tissue samples collected across a collaborative network was developed. Integrated analysis of such datasets from large patient cohorts may help define molecular heterogeneity within RA pathology and identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.</AbstractText> "

M1 or M2-polarised macrophages in synovial tissues of patients with OA and OA mice were analysed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Mice with tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or Rheb deletion specifically in the myeloid lineage were generated and subjected to intra-articular injection of collagenase (collagenase-induced osteoarthritis, CIOA) and destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to induce OA. Cartilage damage and osteophyte size were measured by Osteoarthritis Research Society International score and micro-CT, respectively. mRNA sequencing was performed in M1 and control macrophages. Mice and ATDC5 cells were treated with R-spondin-2 (Rspo2) or anti-Rspo2 to investigate the role of Rspo2 in OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">M1 but not M2-polarised macrophages accumulated in human and mouse OA synovial tissue. TSC1 deletion in the myeloid lineage constitutively activated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), increased M1 polarisation in synovial macrophages and exacerbated experimental OA in both CIOA and DMM models, while Rheb deletion inhibited mTORC1, enhanced M2 polarisation and alleviated CIOA in mice. The results show that promoting the macrophage M1 polarisation leads to exacerbation of experimental OA partially through secretion of Rspo2 and activation of β-catenin signalling in chondrocytes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Synovial macrophage M1 polarisation exacerbates experimental CIOA partially through Rspo2.

The tools Polymorphism Phenotyping, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), Predict the pathology of Mutations (PMUT), Human Mitochondrial Genome Database (mtDB), Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT), and Mammalian Mitochondrial tRNA Genes (Mamit-tRNA) were used to evaluate pathogenicity of alleles. Validation of selected alleles by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of single nucleotide polymorphisms (qPCR SNPs) was also performed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We identified 456 alleles in patients with gout and 640 alleles in non-gout controls with 274 alleles shared by both. Mitochondrial genes were associated with gout, with MT-CO3, MT-TA, MT-TC, and MT-TT containing potentially pathogenic gout-associated alleles and displaying evidence of gene-gene interactions. All heteroplasmy levels of potentially pathogenic alleles exceeded metabolic thresholds for pathogenicity. Validation assays confirmed the next-generation sequencing results of selected alleles.

The aetiology of joint pain in OA is not well understood. The synovial membrane as an innervated joint structure represents a potential source of peripheral pain in OA. Here we analyse, using a hypothesis-free next generation RNA sequencing, the differences in protein-coding and non-coding transcriptomes in knee synovial tissues from OA patients with high knee pain (<i>n</i> = 5) compared with OA patients with low knee pain (<i>n</i> = 5), as evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS). We conduct Gene Ontology and pathway analyses on differentially expressed mRNA genes. We identify new protein-coding, long non-coding RNA and microRNA candidates that can be associated with OA joint pain. Top enriched genes in painful OA knees encode neuronal proteins that are known to promote neuronal survival under cellular stress or participate in calcium-dependent synaptic exocytosis and modulation of GABA(&amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid)ergic activity. Our study uncovers transcriptome changes associated with pain in synovial microenvironment of OA knees. This sets a firm ground for future mechanistic studies and drug discovery to alleviate joint pain in OA.</AbstractText> "

The role of the two monocyte subsets, classical monocytes (expressing CD115, Ly6C and CCR2) and non-classical monocytes (which are CD115 positive, but low in Ly6C and CCR2), in serving as precursors for OC in arthritis is still elusive.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We investigated CCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice, which lack circulating classical monocytes, crossed into hTNFtg mice for the extent of joint damage. We analysed monocyte subsets in hTNFtg and K/BxN serum transfer arthritis by flow cytometry. We sorted monocyte subsets and analysed their potential to differentiate into OC and their transcriptional response in response to RANKL by RNA sequencing. With these data, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We show that in hTNFtg arthritis local bone erosion and OC generation are even enhanced in the absence of CCR2. We further show the numbers of non-classical monocytes in blood are elevated and are significantly correlated with histological signs of joint destruction. Sorted non-classical monocytes display an increased capacity to differentiate into OCs. This is associated with an increased expression of signal transduction components of RANK, most importantly TRAF6, leading to an increased responsiveness to RANKL.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Therefore, non-classical monocytes are pivotal cells in arthritis tissue damage and a possible target for therapeutically intervention for the prevention of inflammatory joint damage.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

The aim of the present study was to use HMGB1 to treat RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and to examine the changes of transcriptional factors. RASFs were isolated from synovial tissues obtained from five RA patients undergoing synovectomy or joint replacement. RASFs were incubated with 100 ng/mL of HMGB1 for different periods. The changes in transcriptional factors were screened by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. The results showed that the mRNA of &gt;60 genes in RASFs were differentially expressed after HMGB1 treatment. Among them, GBA1 was the most markedly decreased (-3.99 folds, P&lt;0.001). These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot. The late-stage inflammatory mediator HMGB1 probably exerts its pathogenic role in RA by downregulating GBA1.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>IJCEP Copyright © 2018.</CopyrightInformation> "

Inflammatory bowel disease and juvenile idiopathic arthritis are both clinically heterogeneous and known to be due in part to abnormal regulation of gene activity in diverse immune cell types. Comparative genomic analysis of these conditions is expected to reveal differences in underlying genetic mechanisms of disease.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We performed RNA-Seq on whole blood samples from 202 patients with oligoarticular, polyarticular, or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, as well as healthy controls, to characterize differences in gene expression. Gene ontology analysis combined with Blood Transcript Module and Blood Informative Transcript analysis was used to infer immunological differences. Comparative expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis was used to quantify disease-specific regulation of transcript abundance.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A pattern of differentially expressed genes and pathways reveals a gradient of disease spanning from healthy controls to oligoarticular, polyarticular, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA); Crohn's disease; and ulcerative colitis. Transcriptional risk scores also provide good discrimination of controls, JIA, and IBD. Most eQTL are found to have similar effects across disease sub-types, but we also identify disease-specific eQTL at loci associated with disease by GWAS.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">JIA and IBD are characterized by divergent peripheral blood transcriptomes, the genetic regulation of which displays limited disease specificity, implying that disease-specific genetic influences are largely independent of, or downstream of, eQTL effects.</AbstractText> "

However, its molecular mechanisms on inner ear development are not clear. In this work, the inner ear morphology was investigated at different embryonic stages of the SOX10 mutation miniature porcine model with sensorineural hearing loss, and high-throughput RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses were applied. Our results indicated that the SOX10 mutation in the miniature pigs led to an incomplete partition (IP) of the cochlea, a cystic apex caused by fusion from middle and apical turns, cochlear modiolar defects and a shortened cochlear duct. The model demonstrated 173 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 185 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The down-regulated DEGs most significantly enriched the inflammatory mediator regulation of the TRP channels, arachidonic acid metabolism, and the salivary secretion pathways, while the up-regulated DEGs most significantly enriched the systemic lupus erythematosus and alcoholism pathways. Based on gene cluster analysis, we selected four gene groups: WNT1, KCNQ4, STRC and PAX6.</AbstractText> "

A number of studies have demonstrated that the expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) is dysregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). So far, all studies on miRNAs in RA patients have been performed using either microarray or reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. Compared to RT-qPCR and microarray analyses, next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows the genome-wide analysis of small RNAs and the differentiation between miRNAs that differ by a single nucleotide. The application of NGS to the analysis of small RNAs circulating in sera of RA patients has not been reported. This study provides a global overview of the circulating small RNAs in the sera of RA patients and healthy subjects and identifies differences between these groups using NGS. Several classes of small RNAs, including hY RNA-derived fragments, tRNA-derived fragments and miRNAs, were determined. Differentially expressed individual small RNAs were verified by RT-qPCR. The levels of two miRNAs, miR-223-3p and miR-16-5p, were significantly lower in the sera from early RA patients than in those from established RA patients and healthy controls. In contrast, the serum level of miR-16-5p was higher in patients with established RA than in healthy control samples. These miRNAs may not only serve as biomarkers, but may also shed more light on the pathophysiology of RA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2018 British Society for Immunology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"415";"29891556";"In Rheumatoid Arthritis, Synovitis at Different Inflammatory Sites Is Dominated by Shared but Patient-Specific T Cell Clones.";" <AbstractText>Genetic and immunological evidence clearly points to a role for T cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Selective targeting of such disease-associated T cell clones might be highly effective while having few side effects. However, such selective targeting may only be feasible if the same T cell clones dominate the immune response at different sites of inflammation. We leveraged high-throughput technology to quantitatively assess whether different T cell clones dominate the inflammatory infiltrate at various sites of inflammation in this prototypic autoimmune disease. In 13 RA patients, we performed quantitative next-generation sequencing-based human TCRβ repertoire analysis in simultaneously obtained samples from inflamed synovial tissue (ST) from distinct locations within one joint, from multiple joints, and from synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB). Identical TCRβ clones dominate inflammatory responses in ST samples taken from different locations within a single joint and when sampled in different joints. Although overall ST-SF overlap was comparable to higher ST-ST values, the overlap in dominant TCRβ clones in ST-SF comparisons was much lower than ST-ST and comparable to the low ST-PB overlap. In individual RA patients, a limited number of TCRβ clones dominate the immune response in the inflamed ST regardless of the location within a joint and which joint undergoes biopsy; in contrast, there is limited overlap of ST with SF or PB TCR repertoires. This limited breadth of the T cell response in ST of the individual RA patient indicates that development of immunotherapies that selectively modulate dominant T cell responses might be feasible.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

At 8 weeks, the experimental group rats were treated by LIPUS for 4 weeks (5 days every week). The cartilage was examined by histological techniques. Gene expression profile in control, placebo and LIPUS-treated group were measured by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Gene oncology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) annotated were performed and ten differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were further validated in another individual by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Per-2, a circadian rhythm gene, was further confirmed by western blot.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">TMJ-OA model was successfully established in rats through UOT. LIPUS played a positive role in attenuating the retrogression of cartilage. The cartilage lesion was determined by HE and Safranin-O staining. A significant and bran-new gene profile of 58 mRNAs was obtained from the RNA-Seq (LIPUS-treated/placebo) and generated approximately 30GB data. Annotation, functional classification and pathway of the data were analyzed based on GO and KEGG database and ten candidate DEGs were identified. Some of these genes were proved to be related to OA, such as matrix-degrading enzyme (ADAMTS-8), complement (C1qa, C3, C5aR1). Some were reported for the first time in TMJ-OA, such as circadian gene (Per-2, Dbp, Npas2 and Arntl). According to the results of qRT-PCR validation, the sequencing data was with a high degree of credibility. The circadian gene Per-2 was up-regulated by LIPUS in TMJ-OA on the mRNA and protein level.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study reveals the potential therapeutic genes related to TMJ-OA. Especially the circadian Per-2 gene was detected up-regulated by the treatment of LIPUS.

We identified multiple rare likely pathogenic variants in nineteen genes co-segregating with the disease through multiple generations. Gene co-expression and protein-protein interaction analysis identified a network of highly connected genes comprising several loci previously implicated in autoimmune diseases. These genes were significantly enriched for immune system development, lymphocyte activation, DNA repair, and V(D)J gene recombination GO-categories. Furthermore, we found evidence of aggregate association and enrichment of rare variants at the FAM71E1/EMC10 locus in an independent set of 4,254 European SLE-cases and 4,349 controls. Our study presents evidence supporting that multiple rare likely pathogenic variants, in newly identified genes involved in known disease pathogenic pathways, segregate with SLE at the familial and population level.</AbstractText> "

The miRNA profile of patients was compared with the miRNA pattern of TLR7-activated pDCs.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"">Among 131 miRNAs detected in pDCs, 35, 17 and 21 had a significantly lower level of expression in SLE, SLE + APS and PAPS patients, respectively, as compared with healthy controls (HC). Notably, the miRNA profile did not significantly differ between SLE and APS, but was driven by the presence or absence of an IFN signature. TLR7 stimulation induced a general downregulation of miRNAs, similar to the pattern observed in SLE and APS patients. miR-361-5p, miR-128-3p and miR-181a-2-3p expression was lower in patients with a high IFN signature (false discovery rate &lt;0.05) as compared with patients with a low IFN signature and HCs. Pathway enrichment on the overlap of miRNA targets and upregulated genes from the RNAseq indicated that these miRNAs are involved in pDC activation and apoptosis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"">Lower miRNA expression in pDCs is shared between SLE, SLE + APS and PAPS and is related to the IFN signature. As pDCs are the alleged source of the IFN signature in these patients, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms/pathways leading to pDC dysregulation in SLE and APS might open novel pathways for therapeutic intervention.</AbstractText> "

Characterization of patient-derived monoclonal antibodies confirmed ACPA and RF targeting of tetramer-specific B cells at both antigen-inexperienced and affinity-matured B cell stages. ACPA+ B cells used more class-switched isotypes and exhibited more somatic hypermutations relative to RF+ B cells, and these differences were accompanied by down-regulation of CD72 and up-regulation of genes that promote class-switching and T cell-dependent responses. In contrast, RF+ B cells expressed transcriptional programs that stimulate rapid memory reactivation through multiple innate immune pathways. Coexpression analysis revealed that ACPA+ and RF+ B cell-enriched genes belong to distinct transcriptional regulatory networks.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our findings suggest that ACPA+ and RF+ B cells are imprinted with distinct transcriptional programs, which suggests that these autoantibodies associated with increased inflammation in RA arise from 2 different molecular mechanisms.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2018, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are key candidate mediators in SSc. Our aim was to elucidate the specific effect of IL-6 pathway blockade on the biology of SSc fibroblasts in vivo by using samples from a unique clinical experiment-the faSScinate study-in which patients with SSc were treated for 24 weeks with tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor-α inhibitor.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We analysed the molecular, functional and genomic characteristics of explant fibroblasts cultured from matched skin biopsy samples collected at baseline and at week 24 from 12 patients receiving placebo (n=6) or TCZ (n=6) and compared these with matched healthy control fibroblast strains.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The hallmark functional and molecular-activated phenotype was defined in SSc samples and was stable over 24 weeks in placebo-treated cases. RNA sequencing analysis robustly defined key dysregulated pathways likely to drive SSc fibroblast activation in vivo. Treatment with TCZ for 24 weeks profoundly altered the biological characteristics of explant dermal fibroblasts by normalising functional properties and reversing gene expression profiles dominated by TGFβ-regulated genes and molecular pathways.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We demonstrated the exceptional value of using explant dermal fibroblast cultures from a well-designed trial in SSc to provide a molecular framework linking IL-6 to key profibrotic pathways.

This study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the transcriptional response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following ALF.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Methods"">ALF was induced by D-galactosamine (D-gal) in a porcine model. PBMCs were separated at time zero (baseline group), 36 h (failure group), and 60 h (dying group) after D-gal injection. Transcriptional profiling was performed using RNA sequencing and analysed using DAVID bioinformatics resources.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"">Compared with the baseline group, 816 and 1,845 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the failure and dying groups, respectively. A total of five and two gene ontology (GO) term clusters were enriched in 107 GO terms in the failure group and 154 GO terms in the dying group. These GO clusters were primarily immune-related, including genes regulating the inflammasome complex and toll-like receptor signalling pathways. Specifically, GO terms related to cell death, including apoptosis, pyroptosis, and autophagy, and those related to fibrosis, coagulation dysfunction, and hepatic encephalopathy were enriched. Seven Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, hematopoietic cell lineage, lysosome, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria, and phagosome and pertussis pathways were mapped for DEGs in the failure group. All of these seven KEGG pathways were involved in the 19 KEGG pathways mapped in the dying group.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"">We found that the dramatic PBMC transcriptome changes triggered by ALF progression was predominantly related to immune responses. The enriched GO terms related to cell death, fibrosis, and so on, as indicated by PBMC transcriptome analysis, seem to be useful in elucidating potential key gene sets in the progression of ALF. A better understanding of these gene sets might be of preventive or therapeutic interest.</AbstractText> "

However, the molecular basis of facet joint osteoarthritis remains largely undetermined. In the current study, we collected facet joint tissue samples from 10 control patients and 48 patients with facet joint osteoarthritis (20 patients with moderate degeneration and 28 with severe degeneration). The control patients underwent internal fixation of the lumbar spine due to vertebral fracture. RNA deep sequencing was performed, and Bioinformatic tools were applied. Among top 30 enriched signaling pathways, we focused on two inflammation-related signaling pathways, Wnt and NF-κB signaling pathways. Subsequently, using the quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we confirmed that in Wnt signaling pathway, the mRNA levels of Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 2 (DKK2), Sex-determining Region Y-box 17 (SOX17), MYC, Cyclin D1, Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II Alpha (CAMK2A), and Wnt Family Member 11 and 5 were increased in facet joint osteoarthritis, while the mRNA levels of WNT Inhibitory Factor 1, Casein Kinase 1 Alpha 1, Transcription Factor 7/Lymphoid Enhancer Binding Factor 1 (TCF7/LEF1), and VANGL Planar Cell Polarity Protein 2 were decreased. In NF-κB signaling pathway, the mRNA levels of C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 4 (CCL4) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 4 Like 2 (CCL4L2) were increased, while the mRNA levels of BCL2 Related Protein A1 were decreased. These results suggest that Wnt and NF-κB signaling may be altered in the process of facet joint cartilage degeneration.

Treg from patients in clinical remission demonstrated a high level of <i>in vitro</i> suppressive function compared with Treg from control subjects and from patients with untreated active disease. PBMC from patients in clinical remission had significantly lower methylation levels at the FOXP3 TSDR, FOXP3 promoter, and TIGIT loci and higher levels at RORC loci than those with active disease.

Since 2000, cobalt-chromium (CoCr) metal-on-metal (MoM) implants were widely used in hip arthroplasties. Some patients developed &quot;adverse reaction to metal debris&quot; (ARMD) around the prosthesis, resulting in a need for revision surgery. In the present study, we addressed the pathogenesis of ARMD by genome-wide expression analysis. Pseudosynovial ARMD tissue was obtained from revision surgery of Articular Surface Replacement (ASR, DePuy, Warsaw, IN, USA) hip arthroplasties. Control tissue was 1) OA synovium from primary hip arthroplasties and 2) inflammatory pseudosynovial tissue from metal-on-plastic (MoP) implant revisions. In ARMD tissue, the expression of 1446 genes was significantly increased and that of 1881 decreased as compared to OA synovium. Genes associated with immune response, tissue development and certain leukocyte signaling pathways were enriched in the differently (FC &gt; 2) expressed genes. The network analysis proposed PRKACB, CD2, CD52 and CD53 as the central regulators of the greatest (FC &gt; 10) differences. When ARMD tissue was compared to MoP tissue, the expression of 16 genes was significantly higher and that of 21 lower. Many of these genes were associated with redox homeostasis, metal ion binding and transport, macrophage activation and apoptosis. Interestingly, genes central to myofibroblast (AEBP1 and DES) and osteoclast (CCL21, TREM2 and CKB) development were upregulated in the MoP tissue. In network analysis, IL8, NQO1, GSTT1 and HMOX1 were identified as potential central regulators of the changes. In conclusion, excessive amounts of CoCr debris produced by MoM hip implants induces in a group of patients a unique adverse reaction characterized with enhanced expression of genes associated with inflammation, redox homeostasis, metal ion binding and transport, macrophage activation and apoptosis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018.

MeCP2 expression was measured by qPCR and western blot. Myofibroblast differentiation was evaluated by gel contraction assay in vitro. Fibroblast proliferation was analysed by ki67 immunofluorescence staining. A wound healing assay in vitro was used to determine fibroblast migration rates. RNA-seq was performed with and without MeCP2 knockdown in dcSSc to identify MeCP2-regulated genes. The expression of MeCP2 and its targets were modulated by siRNA or plasmid. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) using anti-MeCP2 antibody was performed to assess MeCP2 binding sites within MeCP2-regulated genes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Elevated expression of MeCP2 was detected in dcSSc fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts. Overexpressing MeCP2 in normal fibroblasts suppressed myofibroblast differentiation, fibroblast proliferation and fibroblast migration. RNA-seq in MeCP2-deficient dcSSc fibroblasts identified MeCP2-regulated genes involved in fibrosis, including <i>PLAU</i>, <i>NID2</i> and <i>ADA</i>. Plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) overexpression in dcSSc fibroblasts reduced myofibroblast differentiation and fibroblast migration, while nidogen-2 (NID2) knockdown promoted myofibroblast differentiation and fibroblast migration. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) depletion in dcSSc fibroblasts inhibited cell migration rates. Taken together, antifibrotic effects of MeCP2 were mediated, at least partly, through modulating PLAU, NID2 and ADA. ChIP-seq further showed that MeCP2 directly binds regulatory sequences in <i>NID2</i> and <i>PLAU</i> gene loci.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study demonstrates a novel role for MeCP2 in skin fibrosis and identifies MeCP2-regulated genes associated with fibroblast migration, myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix degradation, which can be potentially targeted for therapy in SSc.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

We identified 56 genes with significant differences between osteophytic chondrocytes and low-grade articular cartilage chondrocytes on all three omics levels. Several of these genes have known roles in OA, including ALDH1A2 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, which have functional genetic variants associated with OA from genome-wide association studies. An integrative gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that differences between osteophytic and low-grade articular cartilage chondrocytes are associated with extracellular matrix organization, skeletal system development, platelet aggregation and regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusion"">We present a first comprehensive view of the molecular landscape of chondrocytes from osteophytic cartilage as compared with articular cartilage chondrocytes from the same joints in OA. We found robust changes at genes relevant to chondrocyte function, providing insight into biological processes involved in osteophyte development and thus OA progression.</AbstractText> "

This mutation is the fourth mutation identified in exon 4.The most frequent mutation was R202Q, followed by M694V, E148Q, M680I, R761H, V726A and R354W.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">One of the most important aims of this study is to investigate the MEFV mutation type and genotype of migrants coming to Sanliurfa after the civil war of Syria. This study also examines the effect of the condition on the region&amp;rsquo;s gene pool and the distribution of different types of mutations. Our results indicated that MEFV mutations are highly heterogeneous in our patient population, which is consistent with the findings of other studies in our region. Previously used methods, such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), do not define uncommon or especially novel mutations. Therefore, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of the MEFV gene could be useful for finding novel mutations, except for those located on exon 2 and 10.</AbstractText> "

RNA-sequencing analysis was used to investigate differential expression of ALDH1A2 and other retinoic acid signaling pathway genes in cartilage. Expression of ALDH1A2 in joint tissues obtained from multiple sites was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Allelic expression imbalance (AEI) was measured by pyrosequencing. The consequences of ALDH1A2 depletion by RNA interference were assessed in primary human chondrocytes. In silico and in vitro analyses were used to pinpoint which, among 62 highly correlated SNPs, could account for the association at the locus.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">ALDH1A2 expression was observed across multiple joint tissue samples, including osteochondral tissue from the hand. The expression of ALDH1A2 and of several retinoic acid signaling genes was different in diseased cartilage compared to non-diseased cartilage, with ALDH1A2 showing lower levels in OA cartilage. Experimental depletion of ALDH1A2 resulted in changes in the expression levels of a number of chondrogenic markers, including SOX9. In addition, reduced expression of the OA risk-conferring allele was witnessed in a number of joint tissues, with the strongest effect in cartilage. The intronic SNP rs12915901 recapitulated the AEI observed in patient tissues, while the Ets transcription factors were identified as potential mediators of this effect.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The ALDH1A2 locus seems to increase the risk of hand OA through decreased expression of ALDH1A2 in joint tissues, with the effect dependent on rs12915901.

In addition, the highest CD38 expression was observed on plasma cells and plasmablasts compared to natural killer (NK) cells, classical dendritic cells (DCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and T cells, in blood from healthy controls and patients with SLE and RA. Furthermore, IHC showed CD38 staining in the same region as CD3 and CD138 staining in synovial tissue biopsies from patients with early RA. Most importantly, our data show for the first time that daratumumab effectively depletes plasma cells/plasmablasts in PBMC from patients with SLE and RA in a dose-dependent manner ex vivo.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">These results indicate that CD38 may be a potential target for RA disease interception and daratumumab should be evaluated clinically for the treatment of both RA and SLE.</AbstractText> "

This disorder is genetically heterogeneous with ∼7% of families genetically unresolved. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in two multiplex ADPKD-like pedigrees, and we analyzed a further 591 genetically unresolved, phenotypically similar families by targeted next-generation sequencing of 65 candidate genes. WES identified a DNAJB11 missense variant (p.Pro54Arg) in two family members presenting with non-enlarged polycystic kidneys and a frameshifting change (c.166_167insTT) in a second family with small renal and liver cysts. DNAJB11 is a co-factor of BiP, a key chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum controlling folding, trafficking, and degradation of secreted and membrane proteins. Five additional multigenerational families carrying DNAJB11 mutations were identified by the targeted analysis. The clinical phenotype was consistent in the 23 affected members, with non-enlarged cystic kidneys that often evolved to kidney atrophy; 7 subjects reached ESRD from 59 to 89 years. The lack of kidney enlargement, histologically evident interstitial fibrosis in non-cystic parenchyma, and recurring episodes of gout (one family) suggested partial phenotypic overlap with autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial diseases (ADTKD). Characterization of DNAJB11-null cells and kidney samples from affected individuals revealed a pathogenesis associated with maturation and trafficking defects involving the ADPKD protein, PC1, and ADTKD proteins, such as UMOD. DNAJB11-associated disease is a phenotypic hybrid of ADPKD and ADTKD, characterized by normal-sized cystic kidneys and progressive interstitial fibrosis resulting in late-onset ESRD.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.

The effect of DVL2 on RA-FLS signaling pathway was detected by RNA-seq, and then the key genes were verified by RT-PCR. <b>Results:</b> Compared with the control group, DVL2 significantly increased the apoptosis rate of MH7A (3.2%±2.2% vs 25.7%±4.5%). RNA-seq results showed that DVL2 down-regulated the JAK-STAT pathway.The results of RT-PCR showed that DVL2 inhibited the gene expression of JAK2, Stat1, and Stat2; DVL2 still inhibited the gene expression of JAK2 and Stat2 but not Stat1 after TNF-α stimulation.DVL2 inhibited the gene expression of Bcl-xL, and the gene expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL after TNF-α stimulation. <b>Conclusion:</b> DVL2 can increase the apoptosis rate of RA-FLS through inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway and its downstream anti-apoptotic gene.</AbstractText> "

Genetic analysis is required to confirm the diagnosis. We aimed to describe the identifying symptoms and genotypes of patients referred to our reference centres and to improve the indications for genetic testing. DNA from 66 patients with clinically suspected DADA2 were sequenced by Sanger or next-generation sequencing. Detailed epidemiological, clinical and biological features were collected by use of a questionnaire and were compared between patients with and without genetic confirmation of DADA2. We identified 13 patients (19.6%) carrying recessively inherited mutations in ADA2 that were predicted to be deleterious. Eight patients were compound heterozygous for mutations. Seven mutations were novel (4 missense variants, 2 predicted to affect mRNA splicing and 1 frameshift). The mean age of the 13 patients with genetic confirmation was 12.7 years at disease onset and 20.8 years at diagnosis. Phenotypic manifestations included fever (85%), vasculitis (85%) and neurological disorders (54%). Features best associated with a confirmatory genotype included fever with neurologic or cutaneous attacks (odds ratio [OR] 10.71, p = 0.003 and OR 10.9, p &lt; 0.001), fever alone (OR 8.1, p = 0.01), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level with neurologic involvement (OR 6.63, p = 0.017). Our proposed decision tree may help improve obtaining genetic confirmation of DADA2 in the context of autoinflammatory symptoms. Prerequisites for quick and low-cost Sanger analysis include one typical cutaneous or neurological sign, one marker of inflammation (fever or elevated CRP level), and recurrent or chronic attacks in adults.</AbstractText> "

Immune dysregulation associated to a distinct subset of lupus proinflammatory neutrophils (low density granulocytes; LDGs) may play key roles in conferring enhanced CV risk. This study assessed if lupus LDGs are associated with in vivo vascular dysfunction and inflammation and coronary plaque.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">SLE subjects and healthy controls underwent multimodal phenotyping of vascular disease by quantifying vascular inflammation (18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/CT [18F-FDG-PET/CT]), arterial dysfunction (EndoPAT and cardio-ankle vascular index), and coronary plaque burden (coronary CT angiography). LDGs were quantified by flow cytometry. Cholesterol efflux capacity was measured in high-density lipoprotein-exposed (HDL-exposed) radioactively labeled cell lines. Whole blood RNA sequencing was performed to assess associations between transcriptomic profiles and vascular phenotype.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Vascular inflammation, arterial stiffness, and noncalcified plaque burden (NCB) were increased in SLE compared with controls even after adjustment for traditional risk factors.

"438";"29659823";"A hyperactivating proinflammatory RIPK2 allele associated with early-onset osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common debilitating disease characterized by abnormal remodeling of the cartilage and bone of the articular joint. Ameliorating therapeutics are lacking due to limited understanding of the molecular pathways affecting disease initiation and progression. Notably, although a link between inflammation and overt OA is well established, the role of inflammation as a driver of disease occurrence is highly disputed. We analyzed a family with dominant inheritance of early-onset OA and found that affected individuals harbored a rare variant allele encoding a significant amino acid change (p.Asn104Asp) in the kinase domain of receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), which transduces signals from activated bacterial peptidoglycan sensors through the NF-κB pathway to generate a proinflammatory immune response. Functional analyses of RIPK2 activity in zebrafish embryos indicated that the variant RIPK2104Asp protein is hyperactive in its signaling capacity, with augmented ability to activate the innate immune response and the NF-κB pathway and to promote upregulation of OA-associated genes. Further we show a second allele of RIPK2 linked to an inflammatory disease associated with arthritis also has enhanced activity stimulating the NF-κB pathway. Our studies reveal for the first time the inflammatory response can function as a gatekeeper risk factor for OA.</AbstractText> "

The role of Tnfr1 in arthritis has been documented; however, Tnfr2 functions are unknown. Here, we investigate the mesenchymal-specific role of Tnfr2 in the TnfΔARE mouse model of SpA in arthritis and heart valve stenosis comorbidity by cell-specific, Col6a1-cre-driven gene targeting. We find that TNF/Tnfr2 signaling in resident synovial fibroblasts (SFs) and valvular interstitial cells (VICs) is detrimental for both pathologies, pointing to common cellular mechanisms. In contrast, systemic Tnfr2 provides protective signaling, since its complete deletion leads to severe deterioration of both pathologies. SFs and VICs lacking Tnfr2 fail to acquire pathogenic activated phenotypes and display increased expression of antiinflammatory cytokines associated with decreased Akt signaling. Comparative RNA sequencing experiments showed that the majority of the deregulated pathways in TnfΔARE mesenchymal-origin SFs and VICs, including proliferation, inflammation, migration, and disease-specific genes, are regulated by Tnfr2; thus, in its absence, they are maintained in a quiescent nonpathogenic state. Our data indicate a pleiotropy of Tnfr2 functions, with mesenchymal Tnfr2 driving cell activation and arthritis/valve stenosis pathogenesis only in the presence of systemic Tnfr2, whereas nonmesenchymal Tnfr2 overcomes this function, providing protective signals and, thus, containing both pathologies.</AbstractText> "

The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA-subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA-subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet et al. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]).

The effect of systemic JIA-associated SNPs on gene expression was evaluated in silico in paired whole genome and RNA sequencing data from the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) of 373 European subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project. Responses of systemic JIA-associated SNPs to anakinra treatment were evaluated in 38 US patients for whom treatment response data were available.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We found no association between the previously reported 26 SNPs and systemic JIA. Expanded analysis of the regions containing the 26 SNPs revealed only 1 significant association: the promoter region of IL1RN (P &lt; 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ). Systemic JIA-associated SNPs correlated with IL1RN expression in LCLs, with an inverse correlation between systemic JIA risk and IL1RN expression. The presence of homozygous IL1RN high expression alleles correlated strongly with a lack of response to anakinra therapy (odds ratio 28.7 [95% confidence interval 3.2-255.8]).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">In our study, IL1RN was the only candidate locus associated with systemic JIA. The implicated SNPs are among the strongest known determinants of IL1RN and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist levels, linking low expression with increased systemic JIA risk. Homozygous high expression alleles predicted nonresponsiveness to anakinra therapy, making them ideal candidate biomarkers to guide systemic JIA treatment. This study is an important first step toward the personalized treatment of systemic JIA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2018, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

Array studies of total peripheral blood mononuclear cells have demonstrated gene expression signatures related to neutrophils, interferon, and other inflammatory pathways. It is not clear how consistent these effects are across different cell types. In this study, RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq were utilized to identify gene expression patterns and H3K4me3 histone modifications related to promoter activation in SLE. Across the three cell types, there was 55% concordance for gene expression changes related to SLE. Key conserved pathways were ribosome biogenesis among upregulated genes and heat shock response among downregulated genes. ETS family transcription factors (TFs) and STAT1 were revealed as common regulators by position weight matrices. When epigenetic changes were leveraged with gene expression, the pivotal TFs ATF3 and FOS were defined with ATF3 also cross-referencing with gene expression-identified TFs. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with SLE were cross-referenced with both mRNA and H3K4me3 changes in SLE. Baseline mRNA expression and H3K4me3 peak height was higher at sites that cross-referenced with GWAS signals, however, all three cell types exhibited an overall decrease in expression of GWAS-associated RNAs differentially expressed in SLE. H3K4me3 changes in SLE were also enriched in GWAS-associated sites. In summary, the SLE disease process is associated with both shared and cell-specific changes in gene expression and epigenetics. Surprisingly, GWAS-associated RNAs were overall markedly decreased across all three cell types. TF analysis identified ATF3, FOS, STAT1, and ETS family members as critical, all pathways with a recognized relationship to the SLE disease process. GWAS signals clearly mark both cell-type specific changes in SLE as well as concordant changes across all three cell types. Interpretation of single nucleotide polymorphism effects in SLE will require tissue-specific mechanistic studies and therapeutics will require mechanistic studies in multiple cell types.</AbstractText> "

Previous research has reported genomic variation associated with the likelihood of observing a placebo response, but these studies have been limited in scope and have not been validated. Here, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 784 patients undergoing placebo treatment in Phase III Asthma or Rheumatoid Arthritis trials to assess the impact of previously reported variation on patient outcomes in the placebo arms and to identify novel variants associated with the placebo response. Contrary to expectations based on previous reports, we did not observe any statistically significant associations between genomic variants and placebo treatment outcome. Our findings suggest that the biological origin of the placebo response is complex and likely to be variable between disease areas.</AbstractText> "

Interleukin 17 (IL-17) expression was analyzed by ELISA and real-time (RT)-PCR. Th17 were measured in patients with SLE by flow cytometry before and after HCQ treatment. <i>In vitro</i>, naive T cells were cultured in Th17-inducing conditions with or without HCQ. Cell differentiation and IL-17 expression were analyzed. Finally, transcriptome sequencing identified differential gene expression between naive T cells and induced Th17 cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In patients, HCQ plus prednisone treatment inhibited IL-17 production, gene expression, and Th17 cell differentiation. <i>In vitro</i>, HCQ inhibited Th17 cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as IL-17 production.

Intestinal microbiota were profiled by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing every 7 days during the course of CIA, and intestinal mucosal changes were evaluated on days 14 and 35. Then, microbiota were depleted either early (7 days before immunization) or late (day 21 after immunization) by administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Disease severity, autoantibody and systemic cytokine production, and intestinal mucosal responses were monitored in the setting of microbial reduction.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Significant dysbiosis and mucosal inflammation occurred early in CIA, prior to visible arthritis, and continued to evolve during the course of disease. Depletion of the microbiota prior to the induction of CIA resulted in an ~40% reduction in disease severity and in significantly reduced levels of serum inflammatory cytokines and anti-CII antibodies. In intestinal tissue, production of interleukin-17A (IL-17A) and IL-22 was delayed. Unexpectedly, microbial depletion during the late phase of CIA resulted in a &gt;50% decrease in disease severity. Anti-CII antibodies were mildly reduced but were significantly impaired in their ability to activate complement, likely due to altered glycosylation profiles.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">These data support a model in which intestinal dysbiosis triggers mucosal immune responses that stimulate T and B cells that are key for the development of inflammatory arthritis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2018, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

The histopathologic hallmark of IMM is lymphocytic infiltration of myofibers. The purpose of this study was to identify putative functional variants associated with equine IMM.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A genome-wide association (GWA) study was performed on 36 IMM QHs and 54 breed matched unaffected QHs from the same environment using the Equine SNP50 and SNP70 genotyping arrays.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A mixed model analysis identified nine SNPs within a ~ 2.87 Mb region on chr11 that were significantly (P<sub>unadjusted</sub> &lt; 1.4 × 10<sup>- 6</sup>) associated with the IMM phenotype. Associated haplotypes within this region encompassed 38 annotated genes, including four myosin genes (MYH1, MYH2, MYH3, and MYH13). Whole genome sequencing of four IMM and four unaffected QHs identified a single segregating nonsynonymous E321G mutation in MYH1 encoding myosin heavy chain 2X. Genotyping of additional 35 IMM and 22 unaffected QHs confirmed an association (P = 2.9 × 10<sup>- 5</sup>), and the putative mutation was absent in 175 horses from 21 non-QH breeds. Lymphocytic infiltrates occurred in type 2X myofibers and the proportion of 2X fibers was decreased in the presence of inflammation. Protein modeling and contact/stability analysis identified 14 residues affected by the mutation which significantly decreased stability.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We conclude that a mutation in MYH1 is highly associated with susceptibility to the IMM phenotype in QH-related breeds.

Very few patients with NLRP12-AD have been identified worldwide; therefore, there is a scarcity of data on phenotypic presentation of this syndrome. Here we provide evidence that NLRP12-AID may have clinical manifestations characteristic for primary immune deficiencies (PID). 246 children with periodic fever (PF) of unknown origin were subjects to the next generation sequencing (NGS) analysis; 213 of these patients had signs of primary immunodeficiency (PID) manifested by recurrent infections, while 33 kids had isolated PF. The NGS panel was composed of 302 genes implicated in PID and/or AID. 15 patients (9 girls and 6 boys) with NLRP12-AID were identified. Median age of first AID-related fever episode was 12 months, ranging from 2 months to 13 years. Main clinical features of NLRP12-related AID were periodic fever (100%), abdominal pain and diarrhea (47%), arthralgia (20%), headache (20%) and failure to thrive (33%). Nine patients demonstrated increased susceptibility to infection and two children suffered from Crohn's disease. Administration of short courses of NSAID or corticosteroids resulted in resolution of the disease flare. In one severe case, canakinumab (anti-interleukin-1β antibody) was successfully used. Significant number of patients with genetically assigned diagnosis of NLPR12-AID has clinical features which close resemble primary immune deficiency. This phenotypic overlap may result in underdiagnosis of NLPR12-AID among patients with PID.</AbstractText> "

Behçet's disease is an inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent oral and genital aphthous ulcerations, uveitis, and skin lesions. Preliminarily, our literature review suggested that patients with familial Mediterranean fever who also have Behçet's disease have only a single mutated familial Mediterranean fever gene. The MEFV gene mutation responsible for familial Mediterranean fever is probably a susceptibility factor for Behçet's disease, particularly for patients with vascular involvement, and both disorders can occur concurrently in a patient, as in the present case.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A 10-year-old girl of Moroccan origin presented to our institution for genetic consultation for genetic testing of the MEFV gene.

While this approach offers the exciting promise to deconvolute cellular heterogeneity in diseased tissues, the lack of cost-effective and user-friendly instrumentation has hindered widespread adoption of droplet microfluidic techniques. To address this, we developed a 3D-printed, low-cost droplet microfluidic control instrument and deploy it in a clinical environment to perform single-cell transcriptome profiling of disaggregated synovial tissue from five rheumatoid arthritis patients. We sequence 20,387 single cells revealing 13 transcriptomically distinct clusters. These encompass an unsupervised draft atlas of the autoimmune infiltrate that contribute to disease biology. Additionally, we identify previously uncharacterized fibroblast subpopulations and discern their spatial location within the synovium. We envision that this instrument will have broad utility in both research and clinical settings, enabling low-cost and routine application of microfluidic techniques.</AbstractText> "

Equal numbers were randomly assigned to no further treatment, ACL reconstruction or repair. Perimeniscal synovium for histopathology and RNA-sequencing was harvested at 1 and 4 weeks post-operatively and from six healthy control animals. Microscopic synovitis scores significantly worsened at 1 (p &lt; 0.001) and 4 weeks (p = 0.003) post-surgery relative to controls, and were driven by intimal hyperplasia and increased stromal cellularity without inflammatory infiltrates. Synovitis scores were similar between no treatment, reconstruction, and repair groups (p ≥ 0.668). Relative to no treatment at 1 week, 88 and 367 genes were differentially expressed in the reconstruction and repair groups, respectively (227 and 277 at 4 weeks). Relative to controls and with the treatment groups pooled, 1,683 transcripts were concordantly differentially expressed throughout the post-surgery time-course. Affected pathways included, proteolysis_connective tissue degradation (including upregulations of protease-encoding MMP1, MMP13, and ADAMTS4), and development_cartilage development (including upregulations of ACAN, SOX9, and RUNX2), among others. Using linear regression, significant associations of post-surgery synovial expression levels of 20 genes with the articular cartilage glycosaminoglycan loss were identified. These genes were predominantly related to embryonic skeletal system development and included RUNX2. In conclusion, this study confirmed an increased synovial expression of genes that may serve as targets to prevent cartilage degradation, including MMP1, MMP13, and ADAMTS4, in knees with microscopic synovitis and cartilage proteoglycan loss.

"460";"29432186";"Adaptive antibody diversification through <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation of the immunoglobulin variable region.";" <AbstractText>A hallmark of B-cell immunity is the generation of a diverse repertoire of antibodies from a limited set of germline V(D)J genes. This repertoire is usually defined in terms of amino acid composition. However, variable domains may also acquire <i>N</i>-linked glycans, a process conditional on the introduction of consensus amino acid motifs (<i>N</i>-glycosylation sites) during somatic hypermutation. High levels of variable domain glycans have been associated with autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis, as well as certain follicular lymphomas. However, the role of these glycans in the humoral immune response remains poorly understood. Interestingly, studies have reported both positive and negative effects on antibody affinity. Our aim was to elucidate the role of variable domain glycans during antigen-specific antibody responses. By analyzing B-cell repertoires by next-generation sequencing, we demonstrate that <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites are introduced at positions in which glycans can affect antigen binding as a result of a specific clustering of progenitor glycosylation sites in the germline sequences of variable domain genes. By analyzing multiple human monoclonal and polyclonal (auto)antibody responses, we subsequently show that this process is subject to selection during antigen-specific antibody responses, skewed toward IgG4, and positively contributes to antigen binding. Together, these results highlight a physiological role for variable domain glycosylation as an additional layer of antibody diversification that modulates antigen binding.</AbstractText> "

RNA sequencing was performed on fluorescence-activated cell-sorted neutrophils from 3 patients with active systemic-onset JIA and 3 healthy controls. Expression of activation markers, apoptosis, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and degranulation of secretory vesicles from neutrophils were assessed by flow cytometry in serum samples from 17 patients with systemic-onset JIA and 15 healthy controls.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Neutrophil counts were markedly increased at disease onset, and this correlated with the levels of inflammatory mediators. The neutrophil counts normalized within days after the initiation of rIL-1Ra therapy. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a substantial up-regulation of inflammatory processes in neutrophils from patients with active systemic-onset JIA, significantly overlapping with the transcriptome of sepsis. Correspondingly, neutrophils from patients with active systemic-onset JIA displayed a primed phenotype that was characterized by increased ROS production, CD62L shedding, and secretory vesicle degranulation, which was reversed by rIL-1Ra treatment in patients who had achieved clinical remission. Patients with a short disease duration had high neutrophil counts, more immature neutrophils, and a complete response to rIL-1Ra, whereas patients with symptoms for &gt;1 month had normal neutrophil counts and an unsatisfactory response to rIL-1Ra. In vitro, rIL-1Ra antagonized the priming effect of IL-1β on neutrophils from healthy subjects.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">These results strongly support the notion that neutrophils play an important role in systemic-onset JIA, especially in the early inflammatory phase of the disease.

However, the functional consequences of these SNPs are poorly characterized. Herein, we show in blood cells that SNPs in the PTPN2 locus are highly correlated with DNA methylation levels at four CpG sites downstream of PTPN2 and expression levels of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01882 downstream of these CpG sites. We observed that LINC01882 is mainly expressed in T cells and that anti-CD3/CD28 activated naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells downregulate the expression of LINC01882. RNA sequencing analysis of LINC01882 knockdown in Jurkat T cells, using a combination of antisense oligonucleotides and RNA interference, revealed the upregulation of the transcription factor ZEB1 and kinase MAP2K4, both involved in IL-2 regulation. Overall, our data suggests the involvement of LINC01882 in T cell activation and hints towards an auxiliary role of these non-coding SNPs in autoimmunity associated with the PTPN2 locus.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

"464";"29391272";"Identification of co-occurrence in a patient with Dent's disease and ADA2-deficiency by exome sequencing.";" <AbstractText>Patients with co-occurrence of two independent pathologies pose a challenge for clinicians as the phenotype often presents as an unclear syndrome. In these cases, exome sequencing serves as a powerful instrument to determine the underlying genetic causes. Here, we present the case of a 4-year old boy with proteinuria, microhematuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, livedo-like rash, recurrent abdominal pain, anemia and continuously elevated CRP. Single exome sequencing revealed the pathogenic nonsense mutation p.(Arg98*) in the CLCN5 gene causing the X-linked inherited, renal tubular disorder Dent's disease. Furthermore, the two pathogenic and compound heterozygous missense variants p.(Gly47Ala) and p.(Pro251Leu) in the CECR1 gene could be identified. Mutations in the CECR1 gene are associated with a hereditary form of polyarteritis nodosa, called ADA2-deficiency. Both parents were carriers of a single heterozygous variant in CECR1 and the mother was carrier of the CLCN5 variant. This case evidently demonstrates the advantage of whole exome sequencing compared to single gene testing as the pathology in the CECR1 gene might have only been diagnosed after the occurrence of signs of systemic vasculitis like strokes or hemorrhages. Therefore, treatment and prevention can now start early to improve the outcome of these patients.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite a number of studies exploring the function of PTPN22 in T cells, the exact impact of the PTPN22 risk allele on T-cell function in humans is still unclear. In this study, using RNA sequencing, we show that, upon TCR-activation, naïve human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells homozygous for the PTPN22 risk allele overexpress a set of genes including CFLAR and 4-1BB, which are important for cytotoxic T-cell differentiation. Moreover, the protein expression of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (EOMES) was increased in T cells from healthy donors homozygous for the PTPN22 risk allele and correlated with a decreased number of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. There was no difference in the frequency of other CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets (Th1, Th17, Tfh, Treg). Finally, an accumulation of EOMES<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was observed in synovial fluid of RA patients with a more pronounced production of Perforin-1 in PTPN22 risk allele carriers. Altogether, we propose a novel mechanism of action of PTPN22 risk allele through the generation of cytotoxic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and identify EOMES<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as a relevant T-cell subset in RA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The aim of this study is to explore the differentially expressed genes in normal and aged osteoblasts and to identify genes potentially involved in age-related alteration in bone physiology. Based on next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, 12 differentially expressed microRNAs and 22 differentially expressed genes were identified. Up-regulation of miR-204-5p was validated in an array of osteoporotic hip fracture in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE74209). The putative targets for miR-204-5p were Kruppel-like factor 7 (<i>KLF7</i>) and SRY-box 11 (<i>SOX11</i>). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified <i>SOX11</i>, involved in osteoarthritis pathway and differentiation of osteoblasts, together with miR-204-5p, a potential upstream regulator, suggesting the critical role of miR-204-5p-<i>SOX11</i> regulation in the aging process of human bones. In addition, as semaphorin 3A (<i>SEMA3A</i>) and ephrin type-A receptor 5 (<i>EPHA5</i>) were involved in nervous system related biological functions, we postulated a potential linkage between <i>SEMA3A</i>, <i>EPHA5</i> and development of neurogenic heterotopic ossification. Our findings implicate new candidate genes in the diagnosis of geriatric musculoskeletal disorders, and provide novel insights that may contribute to the elaboration of new biomarkers for neurogenic heterotopic ossification.</AbstractText> "

The aim of this study was to elucidate the HCMV gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE patients and demonstrate the effect and mechanism of viral gene associated with SLE in mono-macrophages functions. Using two RNA-Seq techniques in combination with RT-PCR, 11 viral genes mainly associated with latent HCMV infection were identified in the PBMCs of SLE patients. Among these viral genes, US31 with previously unknown function was highly expressed in the PBMCs of SLE patients compared to healthy controls. Analysis of function indicated that US31 expression could induce inflammation in monocyte and macrophage and stimulate macrophage differentiation toward an M1 macrophage phenotype. Screening via protein chips in combination with bioinformatic analysis and consequent detection of mono-macrophages function indicates that the direct interaction between US31 and NF-κB2 contributed the NF-kB2 activation. Consequent analysis indicated US31 directly interacted with NF-κB2, contribute to the polyubiquitination of the phosphorylated p100 and consequent activation of NF-κB2. Taken together, our data uncovered a previously unknown role of the HCMV protein US31 in inducing NF-κB-mediated mono-macrophage inflammation in the pathogenesis and development of SLE. Our findings provide a foundation for the continued investigation of novel therapeutic targets for SLE patients.</AbstractText> "

Patients' primary cells were used for deep RNA and tRNA sequencing, cytokine profiling, immunophenotyping, immunoblotting and electron microscopy (EM).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We identified eight mutations in these nine patients, three of which have not been previously associated with SIFD. Three patients died in early childhood. Inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin (IL)-6, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and IFN-induced cytokines were elevated in the serum, whereas tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1β were present in tissue biopsies of patients with active inflammatory disease. Deep tRNA sequencing of patients' fibroblasts showed significant deficiency of mature cytosolic tRNAs. EM of bone marrow and skin biopsy samples revealed striking abnormalities across all cell types and a mix of necrotic and normal-appearing cells. By immunoprecipitation, we found evidence for dysregulation in protein clearance pathways. In 4/4 patients, treatment with a TNF inhibitor suppressed inflammation, reduced the need for blood transfusions and improved growth.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Mutations of <i>TRNT1</i> lead to a severe and often fatal syndrome, linking protein homeostasis and autoinflammation.

Our differential expression and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis in SSc was further integrated with epigenetic, expression and eQTL data from skin, monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We identified 602 genes upregulated and downregulated in SSc macrophages that were significantly enriched for genes previously implicated in SSc susceptibility (P=5×10<sup>-4</sup>), and 270 <i>cis</i>-regulated genes in MDMs. Among these, <i>GSDMA</i> was reported to carry an SSc risk variant (rs3894194) regulating expression of neighbouring genes in blood. We show that <i>GSDMA</i> is upregulated in SSc MDMs (P=8.4×10<sup>-4</sup>) but not in the skin, and is a significant eQTL in SSc macrophages and lipopolysaccharide/interferon gamma (IFNγ)-stimulated monocytes.

However, genetic and environmental factors involved in RA pathogenesis are still remained largely unknown. To identify the genetic causal variants underlying pathogenesis and disease progression of RA patients, we undertook the first comprehensive whole-exome sequencing (WES) study in a total of 124 subjects including 58 RA cases and 66 healthy controls in Han Chinese population. We identified 378 novel genes that were enriched with deleterious variants in RA patients using a gene burden test. The further functional effects of associated genetic genes were classified and assessed, including 21 newly identified genes that were involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, focal adhesion and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways relevant to RA pathogenesis. Moreover, six pathogenic variants were investigated and structural analysis predicted their potentially functional alteration by homology modeling. Importantly, five novel and rare homozygous variants (<i>NCR3LG1</i>, <i>RAP1GAP</i>, <i>CHCHD5</i>, <i>HIPK2</i> and <i>DIAPH2</i>) were identified, which may exhibit more functional impact on RA pathogenesis. Notably, 7 genes involved in the olfactory transduction pathway were enriched and associated with RA disease progression. Therefore, we performed an efficient and powerful technique WES in Chinese RA patients and identified novel, rare and common disease causing genes that alter innate immunity pathways and contribute to the risk of RA. Findings in this study may provide potential diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for RA patients.</AbstractText> "

Cecum and colon tissue specimens or contents were collected from the rats at 2, 3-4, and 6-8 months of age, and histologic analysis was performed to assess inflammation, RNA sequencing was used to determine gene expression differences, and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to determine microbiota differences.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Both HLA-B27-transgenic Lewis rats and HLA-B27-transgenic Fischer rats developed gut inflammation, while DA rats were resistant to the effects of HLA-B27, and HLA-B7-transgenic rats were not affected. Immune dysregulation was similar in affected Lewis and Fischer rats and was dominated by activation of interleukin-23 (IL-23)/IL-17, interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and IL-1 cytokines and pathways in the colon and cecum, while DA rats exhibited low-level cytokine dysregulation without inflammation. Gut microbial changes in HLA-B27-transgenic rats were strikingly divergent on the 3 different host genetic backgrounds, including different patterns of dysbiosis in HLA-B27-transgenic Lewis and HLA-B27-transgenic Fischer rat strains, with some overlap. Interestingly, DA rats lacked segmented filamentous bacteria that promote CD4+ Th17 cell development, which may explain their resistance to disease.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The effects of HLA-B27 on gut microbiota and dysbiosis in SpA are highly dependent on the host genetic background and/or environment, despite convergence of dysregulated immune pathways.

Analysis by unsupervised clustering identified two distinct OA groups: Group A with 24 patients (55%) and Group B with 18 patients (41%). A 10 gene subgroup classifier was validated by RT-qPCR in 16 further patients with OA. Pathway analysis showed increased protein expression in both groups. PhenomeExpress analysis revealed group differences in complement activation, innate immune responses and altered Wnt and TGFβ signalling, but no activation of inflammatory cytokine expression. Both groups showed suppressed circadian regulators and whereas matrix changes in Group A were chondrogenic, in Group B they were non-chondrogenic with changes in mechanoreceptors, calcium signalling, ion channels and in cytoskeletal organisers. The gene expression changes predicted 478 potential biomarkers for detection in synovial fluid to distinguish patients from the two groups.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Two subgroups of knee OA were identified by network analysis of RNA-Seq data with evidence for the presence of two major pathogenic pathways.

"475";"29247798";"Circular RNA expression profile of articular chondrocytes in an IL-1β-induced mouse model of osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widely prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by articular cartilage degradation and joint inflammation. The pathogenesis of OA remains unclear, leading to a lack of effective treatment. Previous studies have reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the development of various diseases. However, the function of circRNAs and their roles in OA is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate changes in circRNA expression and predict their functions in OA by using bioinformatics analysis. An OA model was established in mouse articular chondrocytes (MACs) treated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and then the circRNA profile was screened by Next Generation Sequencing. By comparing circRNA expression in IL-1β- treated MACs and normal controls, differentially expressed circRNAs were identified during OA pathogenesis, and differential expression levels of selected circRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were employed to predict the functions of these circRNAs. Because circRNAs can act as &quot;miRNA sponges&quot;, we also constructed a circRNA-miRNA network to predict their functions. A total of 255 circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in IL-1β-treated MACs (p≤0.05; fold-change≥2) from the expression of the normal controls. Among them, 119 circRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and the other 136 were down-regulated. Seven circRNAs were randomly selected to verify the reliability of these profiles by quantitative qRT-PCR. After obtaining the parental genes of differentially expressed circRNA, the top 30 enrichment GO entries and KEGG pathways were annotated. Then, two significantly differentially expressed circRNAs (mmu-circRNA-30365 and mmu-circRNA-36866) were identified and selected for further analysis, meanwhile a circRNA-miRNA regulation network was created and the top five most likely functional-related target miRNAs of the circRNAs were collected. Although the exact mechanisms and biological functions of these circRNAs in the development of OA need further exploration, our findings do suggest that the differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in the pathogenesis of OA. Thus, our study brings us closer to understanding the pathogenic mechanisms and finding new molecular targets for the clinical treatment of osteoarthritis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanism(s) of action of PPS in mediating these effects remains unresolved. In the present report we address this issue by investigating the binding and uptake of PPS by MPCs and monitoring gene expression and proteoglycan biosynthesis before and after the cells had been exposed to limited concentrations of PPS and then re-established in culture in the absence of the drug (MPC priming).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Immuno-selected STRO-1<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal progenitor stem cells (MPCs) were prepared from human bone marrow aspirates and established in culture. The kinetics of uptake, shedding, and internalization of PPS by MPCs was determined by monitoring the concentration-dependent loss of PPS media concentrations using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the uptake of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled PPS by MPCs. The proliferation of MPCs, following pre-incubation and removal of PPS (priming), was assessed using the Wst-8 assay method, and proteoglycan synthesis was determined by the incorporation of <sup>35</sup>SO<sub>4</sub> into their sulphated glycosaminoglycans. The changes in expression of MPC-related cell surface antigens of non-primed and PPS-primed MPCs from three donors was determined using flow cytometry.

Following PPS-priming of MPCs and a further 48 h of culture, both cell proliferation and proteoglycan synthesis were enhanced. Reduced expression of MPC-related cell surface antigen expression was promoted by the PPS priming, and RNA sequencing analysis revealed changes in the expression of 42 genes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study has shown that priming of MPCs with low concentrations of PPS enhanced chondrogenesis and MPC proliferation by modifying their characteristic basal gene and protein expression.

RNA-Seq revealed that the expression levels of 18 molecules were more than twofold higher in resistin-stimulated FLSs than in unstimulated FLSs. Seven chemokines, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, and CCL2, were included among the 18 molecules. Increases induced in the expression of CXCL1, CXCL8, and CCL2 by the resistin stimulation were confirmed by real-time PCR. The stimulation with resistin increased the protein levels of CXCL8 and CCL2 produced by RA FLSs, and the upregulated expression of CXCL8 was inhibited by the abrogation of CAP1 by siRNA for CAP1.

Rare variant associations, expected to explain far less of the heritability, may be enriched in core disease genes and thus will be instrumental in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis and their potential therapeutic targets. Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the &gt;80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-κB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results identify three novel genes in SLE susceptibility and support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2017.

Rare deleterious gene variants driving relevant molecular pathways may play a key role in the pathogenesis and genetic control of common diseases and may also influence the common gene variants observed in GWAS. We use molecular profiling technologies based on massive sequencing of genes to interrogate clinical samples for a variety of molecules involved in the pathogenesis pathways of OA and also to derive new insights for drug targeting discovery at an early stage of the disease. By whole-exome sequencing performed in OA patients with extreme phenotypes and in non-related individuals without clinical evidence of OA, the most predominant of the rare gene variants found were non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNV) from exonic DNA regions and with missense functional effects predicting a moderate impact on protein function. A total of 629, 577, and 639 gene variants for the TPF, COA, and ANHNF patients, respectively, were found not to be shared with the 20 non-disease-related individuals. After subtraction of the 306 variants shared among the OA patients, we obtained the individual profiles of 323, 271, and 333 gene variants, for the TPF, COA, and ANHNF patients, respectively. After filtering by the bioinformatics, genetic, and biological criteria established to assess the clinical consequences, comparative analysis of trio sequences using integrative genome visualization tool clearly demonstrate the differences between patients. Analysis of the collagen gene variants identified 78, 20, and 43 genetic collagen variants for the three extreme phenotypes. Rare gene variants encoding for proteins that are less abundant in the trabecular bone matrix, together with those responsible for the control and regulation of bone turnover and plasticity of subchondral trabecular bone, play important roles in OA and help to define the clinical phenotype.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Seven CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (naive, Th1, Th17, Th1/17, nonTh1/17, Tfh and Treg) were sorted from PBMCs taken from 10 RA patients and 10 healthy controls, and three RA patients donated samples before and 6 months after abatacept treatment. Paired-end RNA sequencing was performed using HiSeq 2500. A total of 149 samples except for 12 outliers were analyzed. Overview of expression pattern of RA revealed that administration of abatacept exerts a large shift toward the expression pattern of HC. Most of differentially expressed gene (DEG) upregulated in RA (n = 1776) were downregulated with abatacept treatment (n = 1349). Inversely, most of DEG downregulated in RA (n = 1860) were upregulated with abatacept treatment (n = 1294). This DEG-based analysis revealed shared pathway changes in RA CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. Knowledge-based pathway analysis revealed the upregulation of activation-related pathways in RA that was substantially ameliorated by abatacept. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) evaluated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells collectively and identified a gene module that consisted of 227 genes and was correlated with DAS28-CRP (Spearman's rho = 0.46, p = 4 × 10<sup>-9</sup>) and abatacept administration (Spearman's rho = -0.91, p = 5 × 10<sup>-57</sup>). The most highly connected 30 genes of this module included ZAP70 and JAK3, and pathway analysis of this module revealed dysregulation of the TCR signaling pathway network, which was ameliorated by abatacept.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study is to explore novel microRNAs differentially expressed in RA osteoblasts and to identify genes potentially involved in the dysregulated bone homeostasis in RA. RNAs were extracted from cultured normal and RA osteoblasts for sequencing. Using the next generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, we identified 35 differentially expressed microRNAs and 13 differentially expressed genes with potential microRNA-mRNA interactions in RA osteoblasts. The 13 candidate genes were involved mainly in cell-matrix adhesion, as classified by the Gene Ontology. Two genes of interest identified from RA osteoblasts, A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (<i>AKAP12</i>) and leucin rich repeat containing 15 (<i>LRRC15</i>), were found to express more consistently in the related RA synovial tissue arrays in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, with the predicted interactions with miR-183-5p and miR-146a-5p, respectively. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified <i>AKAP12</i> as one of the genes involved in protein kinase A signaling and the function of chemotaxis, interconnecting with molecules related to neovascularization. The findings indicate new candidate genes as the potential indicators in evaluating therapies targeting chemotaxis and neovascularization to control joint destruction in RA.</AbstractText> "

In vitro, the variant dominantly inhibited AIRE; however, typical features of Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis and Ectodermal Dysplasia (APECED) were not seen in the subjects. Rather, early manifestation of autoimmunity appeared to be dependent on additional genetic factors. On a population level, diverse variants were identified in this region. Surprisingly, many likely pathogenic variants were seen disproportionately in Africans when compared to Europeans, reinforcing the importance of these variants in altering the immune repertoire. In light of these findings, we propose that R247C and other variants within the SAND-domain alter protein function in a dominant fashion and hold potential as drivers of autoimmunity.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a complex disorder having environmental and genetic causes. Existing techniques fail to detect milder forms of DDH in newborns leading to hip osteoarthritis in young adults. A sensitive, specific and cost effective test would allow identification of newborns that could be non-invasively corrected by the use of a Pavlik harness. Previously, we identified a 2.5 MB candidate region on human chromosome 3 by using linkage analysis of a 4 generation, 72 member family. Whole exome sequencing of the DNA of 4 severely affected members revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism variant, rs3732378 co-inherited by all 11 affected family members. This variant causes a threonine to methionine amino acid change in the coding sequence of the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor and is predicted to be harmful to the function of the protein To gain further insight into the function of this mutation we examined the effect of CX3CR1 ablation on the architecture of the mouse acetabulum and on the murine gait.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The hips of 5 and 8 weeks old wild type and CX3CR1 KO mice were analyzed using micro-CT to measure acetabular diameter and ten additional dimensional parameters. Eight week old mice were gait tested using an inclined treadmill with and without load and then underwent micro-CT analysis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">(1) KO mice showed larger a 5-17% larger diameter left acetabula than WT mice at both ages. (2) At 8 weeks the normalized area of space (i.e. size discrepancy) between the femur head and acetabulum is significantly larger [38% (p = 0.001)-21% (p = 0.037)] in the KO mice. (3) At 8 weeks gait analysis of these same mice shows several metrics that are consistent with impairment in the KO but not the WT mice. These deficits are often seen in mice and humans who develop hip OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The effect of CX3CR1 deletion on murine acetabular development provides suggestive evidence of a susceptibility inducing role of the CX3CR1 gene on DDH.</AbstractText> "

We characterized the dynamic repertoire of the chondrocyte miRNome and miRISC-associated miRNome by deep sequencing analysis of primary human chondrocytes. IL-1β treatment showed a modest effect on the expression profile of miRNAs in normal and osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes. We found a number of miRNAs that showed a wide range of sequence modifications including nucleotide additions and deletions at 5' and 3' ends; and nucleotide substitutions. miR-27b-3p showed the highest expression and miR-140-3p showed the highest number of sequence variations. AGO2 RIP-Seq analysis revealed the differential recruitment of a subset of expressed miRNAs and isoforms of miRNAs (isomiRs) to the miRISC in response to IL-1β, including miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-27b-3p. Together, these results reveal a complex repertoire of miRNAs and isomiRs in primary human chondrocytes. Here, we also show the changes in miRNA composition of the miRISC in primary human chondrocytes in response to IL-1β treatment. These findings will provide an insight to the miRNA-mediated control of gene expression in the pathogenesis of OA.</AbstractText> "

On this evidence, CVID is potentially polygenic and epistatic although there are, as yet, no examples to support this hypothesis. We have identified a non-consanguineous family, who carry the C104R (c.310T&gt;C) mutation of the Transmembrane Activator Calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand Interactor (TACI, <i>TNFRSF13B</i>) gene. Variants in <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI are identified in up to 10% of CVID patients, and are associated with, but not solely causative of CVID. The proband is heterozygous for the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI C104R mutation and meets the Ameratunga <i>et al.</i> diagnostic criteria for CVID and the American College of Rheumatology criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her son has type 1 diabetes, arthritis, reduced IgG levels and IgA deficiency, but has not inherited the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI mutation. Her brother, homozygous for the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI mutation, is in good health despite profound hypogammaglobulinemia and mild cytopenias. We hypothesised that a second unidentified mutation contributed to the symptomatic phenotype of the proband and her son. Whole-exome sequencing of the family revealed a <i>de novo</i> nonsense mutation (T168fsX191) in the Transcription Factor 3 (<i>TCF3</i>) gene encoding the E2A transcription factors, present only in the proband and her son. We demonstrate mutations of <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI impair immunoglobulin isotype switching and antibody production predominantly via T-cell-independent signalling, while mutations of <i>TCF3</i> impair both T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways of B-cell activation and differentiation. We conclude that epistatic interactions between mutations of the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI and <i>TCF3</i> signalling networks lead to the severe CVID-like disorder and SLE in the proband.</AbstractText> "
"489";"29106758";"Transcriptomic analysis of synovial extracellular RNA following knee trauma: A pilot study.";" <AbstractText>Traumatic knee injuries often result in damage to articular cartilage and other joint structures. Such trauma is a strong risk factor for the future development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways modulating response to knee joint trauma remain unclear. Moreover, investigations of biomarkers influencing responses have been targeted rather than broad, unbiased discovery studies. Herein, we characterize the complete complement of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in the synovial fluid of 14 subjects following knee injury. Fluid was collected during surgery from the injured knees, and from the contralateral knee in a subset, undergoing surgical repair of the ACL and/or meniscal repair/debridement. Arthroscopic grading of chondral damage in four knee compartments was performed using the Outerbridge classification. exRNA was extracted and subjected to massively parallel total RNA sequencing. Differential abundance of RNA was calculated between the subject cohorts of injured and non-injured knee, average Outerbridge score ≥0.5 and less, and chronic and acute injury duration defined as ≤4 months till surgery or longer. Overall, expression of several thousand genes was identified in the synovial fluid. Furthermore, differential expression analysis suggests a role of exRNA fragments of matrix metalloproteinases and skeletal muscle fiber genes in the response to traumatic injury. Together, these data suggest that high-throughput approaches can indicate exRNA molecular signatures following knee trauma. Future studies are required to more fully characterize the biological roles of these exRNA and the cadence of their respective release that may lead to translational treatment options for post-traumatic OA. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

"490";"29059182";"Profiling RNA-Seq at multiple resolutions markedly increases the number of causal eQTLs in autoimmune disease.";" <AbstractText>Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of risk loci for autoimmune disease, yet only a minority (~25%) share genetic effects with changes to gene expression (eQTLs) in immune cells. RNA-Seq based quantification at whole-gene resolution, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is likely to account for this observed lack of colocalisation as subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons can be concealed. We performed integrative cis-eQTL analysis using association statistics from twenty autoimmune diseases (560 independent loci) and RNA-Seq data from 373 individuals of the Geuvadis cohort profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level resolution in lymphoblastoid cell lines. After stringently testing for a shared causal variant using both the Joint Likelihood Mapping and Regulatory Trait Concordance frameworks, we found that gene-level quantification significantly underestimated the number of causal cis-eQTLs. Only 5.0-5.3% of loci were found to share a causal cis-eQTL at gene-level compared to 12.9-18.4% at exon-level and 9.6-10.5% at junction-level. More than a fifth of autoimmune loci shared an underlying causal variant in a single cell type by combining all five quantification types; a marked increase over current estimates of steady-state causal cis-eQTLs. Causal cis-eQTLs detected at different quantification types localised to discrete epigenetic annotations. We applied a linear mixed-effects model to distinguish cis-eQTLs modulating all expression elements of a gene from those where the signal is only evident in a subset of elements. Exon-level analysis detected disease-associated cis-eQTLs that subtly altered transcription globally across the target gene. We dissected in detail the genetic associations of systemic lupus erythematosus and functionally annotated the candidate genes. Many of the known and novel genes were concealed at gene-level (e.g. IKZF2, TYK2, LYST). Our findings are provided as a web resource.</AbstractText> "

The syndrome is caused by mutations in SLC29A3, a gene located on chromosome 10q23, which encodes the human equilibrative transporter 3 (hENT3). Less than 100 patients with H syndrome have been described in the literature, with the majority being of Arab descent, and only a few from North America.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Here we report five pediatric patients from three medical centers in the United States who were identified to have H syndrome by whole exome sequencing. These five patients, all of whom presented to pediatric rheumatologists prior to diagnosis, include two of Northern European descent, bringing the total number of Caucasian patients described to three. The patients share many of the characteristics previously reported with H syndrome, including hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, short stature, insulin-dependent diabetes, arthritis and systemic inflammation, as well as some novel features, including selective IgG subclass deficiency and autoimmune hepatitis. They share genetic mutations previously described in patients of the same ethnic background, as well as a novel mutation. In two patients, treatment with prednisone improved inflammation, however both patients flared once prednisone was tapered. In one of these patients, treatment with tocilizumab alone resulted in marked improvement in systemic inflammation and growth. The other had partial response to prednisone, azathioprine, and TNF inhibition; thus, his anti-TNF biologic was recently switched to tocilizumab due to persistent polyarthritis. Another patient improved on Methotrexate, with further improvement after the addition of tocilizumab.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">H syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory syndrome with pleiotropic manifestations that affect multiple organ systems and is often mistaken for other conditions. Rheumatologists should be aware of this syndrome and its association with arthritis. It should be considered in patients with short stature and systemic inflammation, particularly with cutaneous findings. Some patients respond to treatment with biologics alone or in combination with other immune suppressants; in particular, treatment of systemic inflammation with IL-6 blockade appears to be promising. Overall, better identification and understanding of the pathophysiology may help devise earlier diagnosis and better treatment strategies.</AbstractText> "

Particularly, model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single cell transcriptomic data are still under-explored.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"">We developed DIMM-SC, a Dirichlet Mixture Model for clustering droplet-based Single Cell transcriptomic data. This approach explicitly models UMI count data from scRNA-Seq experiments and characterizes variations across different cell clusters via a Dirichlet mixture prior. We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate DIMM-SC and compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree and Seurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seq datasets with known cluster labels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a study of systemic sclerosis with prior biological knowledge to benchmark and validate DIMM-SC. Both simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that overall, DIMM-SC achieves substantially improved clustering accuracy and much lower clustering variability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, as a model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell, facilitating rigorous statistical inference and biological interpretations, which are typically unavailable from existing clustering methods.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Availability and implementation"">DIMM-SC has been implemented in a user-friendly R package with a detailed tutorial available on www.pitt.edu/∼wec47/singlecell.html.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Contact"">wei.chen@chp.edu or hum@ccf.org.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Supplementary information"">Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

In this study, we used multiple approaches including genomic analysis to investigate and characterize the possible molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxicity of leflunomide in hepatic cells. We found that leflunomide caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated an unfolded protein response, as evidenced by increased expression of related genes including CHOP and GADD34; and elevated protein levels of typical ER stress markers including CHOP, ATF-4, p-eIF2α, and spliced XBP1. The secretion of Gaussia luciferase was suppressed in cells treated with leflunomide in an ER stress reporter assay. Inhibition of ER stress with an ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate, and knockdown of ATF-4 and CHOP genes partially protected cells upon leflunomide exposure. In addition, both genomic and biochemical analyses revealed that JNK and ERK1/2 of MAPK signaling pathways were activated, and both contributed to the leflunomide-induced cytotoxicity. Inhibiting JNK activation using a JNK inhibitor attenuated the ER stress and cytotoxicity of leflunomide, whereas inhibiting ERK1/2 using an ERK1/2 inhibitor or ERK1/2 siRNA increased the adverse effect caused by leflunomide, suggesting opposite roles for the two pathways. In summary, our data indicate that both ER stress and the activation of JNK and ERK1/2 contribute to leflunomide-induced cytotoxicity.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier B.V.</CopyrightInformation> "

Central nervous system vasculitis is a prominent cause of childhood strokes. 10 families with familial chilblain lupus related to TREX1 mutations were reported previously in the literature, in which homozygote D18N variant in TREX1 gene was related to chilblains with cerebral vasculitis. In this report, whole-exome-sequencing revealed a homozygote R114C mutation in TREX1 gene was shown in two siblings with recurrent chilblains whom one of them was the second case accompanied by cerebral vasculitis in the literature.

"497";"28892097";"Ligand-mediated cytoplasmic retention of the Ah receptor inhibits macrophage-mediated acute inflammatory responses.";" <AbstractText>The Ah receptor (AHR) has been shown to exhibit both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activity in a context-specific manner. In vivo macrophage-driven acute inflammation models were utilized here to test whether the selective Ah receptor modulator 1-allyl-7-trifluoromethyl-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-methoxyphenol (SGA360) would reduce inflammation. Exposure to SGA360 was capable of significantly inhibiting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated endotoxic shock in a mouse model, both in terms of lethality and attenuating inflammatory signaling in tissues. Topical exposure to SGA360 was also able to mitigate joint edema in a monosodium urate (MSU) crystal gout mouse model. Inhibition was dependent on the expression of the high-affinity allelic AHR variant in both acute inflammation models. Upon peritoneal MSU crystal exposure SGA360 pretreatment inhibited neutrophil and macrophage migration into the peritoneum. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SGA360 attenuated the expression of numerous inflammatory genes and genes known to be directly regulated by AHR in thioglycolate-elicited primary peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS. In addition, expression of the high-affinity allelic AHR variant in cultured macrophages was necessary for SGA360-mediated repression of inflammatory gene expression. Mechanistic studies revealed that SGA360 failed to induce nuclear translocation of the AHR and actually enhanced cytoplasmic localization. LPS treatment of macrophages enhanced the occupancy of the AHR and p65 to the Ptgs2 promoter, whereas SGA360 attenuated occupancy. AHR ligand activity was detected in peritoneal exudates isolated from MSU-treated mice, thus suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity of SGA360 is mediated at least in part through AHR antagonism of endogenous agonist activity. These results underscore an important role of the AHR in participating in acute inflammatory signaling and warrants further investigations into possible clinical applications.</AbstractText> "

We hypothesized that tDMARD would impact multiple biological pathways, but the specific pathways were unknown.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Paired synovial biopsy samples from early RA patients before and after 6 months of tDMARD therapy were collected by arthroscopy (n = 19). These biopsies as well as those from subjects with normal synovium (n = 28) were profiled by total RNA sequencing.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Large differences in gene expression between RA and control biopsies (over 5000 genes) were identified. Despite clinical efficacy, the expression of a restricted set of less than 300 genes was reversed after 6 months of treatment. Many genes remained elevated, even in patients who achieved low disease activity. Interestingly, tDMARD downregulated genes included those involved in T cell activation and signaling and plasmablast/plasma cell differentiation and function.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We have identified transcriptomic signatures that characterize synovial tissue from RA patients with early disease. Analysis after 6 months of tDMARD treatment highlight consistent alterations in expression of genes related to T cell activation and plasmablast/plasma cell differentiation. These results provide novel insight into the biology of early RA and the mechanism of tDMARD action and may help identify novel drug targets to improve rates of treatment-induced disease remission.</AbstractText> "

The underlying molecular changes underpinning disease progression are incompletely understood. We investigated genes and pathways that mark OA progression in isolated primary chondrocytes taken from paired intact versus degraded articular cartilage samples across 38 patients undergoing joint replacement surgery (discovery cohort: 12 knee OA, replication cohorts: 17 knee OA, 9 hip OA patients). We combined genome-wide DNA methylation, RNA sequencing, and quantitative proteomics data. We identified 49 genes differentially regulated between intact and degraded cartilage in at least two -omics levels, 16 of which have not previously been implicated in OA progression. Integrated pathway analysis implicated the involvement of extracellular matrix degradation, collagen catabolism and angiogenesis in disease progression. Using independent replication datasets, we showed that the direction of change is consistent for over 90% of differentially expressed genes and differentially methylated CpG probes. AQP1, COL1A1 and CLEC3B were significantly differentially regulated across all three -omics levels, confirming their differential expression in human disease. Through integration of genome-wide methylation, gene and protein expression data in human primary chondrocytes, we identified consistent molecular players in OA progression that replicated across independent datasets and that have translational potential.</AbstractText> "

We used an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic approach to analyze chromatin accessibility, histone modifications, transcription-factor binding, and gene expression in IFN-γ-primed human macrophages. IFN-γ suppressed basal expression of genes corresponding to an &quot;M2&quot;-like homeostatic and reparative phenotype. IFN-γ repressed genes by suppressing the function of enhancers enriched for binding by transcription factor MAF. Mechanistically, IFN-γ disassembled a subset of enhancers by inducing coordinate suppression of binding by MAF, lineage-determining transcription factors, and chromatin accessibility. Genes associated with MAF-binding enhancers were suppressed in macrophages isolated from rheumatoid-arthritis patients, revealing a disease-associated signature of IFN-γ-mediated repression. These results identify enhancer inactivation and disassembly as a mechanism of IFN-γ-mediated gene repression and reveal that MAF regulates the macrophage enhancer landscape and is suppressed by IFN-γ to augment macrophage activation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although generally thought to be driven by a systemic autoimmune response, increasing evidence suggests that intrinsic changes in the muscle might also contribute to the pathogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of novel genes that regulate gene transcription and translation. To determine the potential role of lncRNAs, we employed next generation sequencing to examine the transcriptome in muscle biopsies obtained from two histologically distinct patient populations, inclusion body myositis (IBM) and anti-Jo-1-associated myositis (Jo-1). 1287 mRNAs and 1068 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the muscle from Jo-1 and IBM patients, respectively. Pathway analysis showed the top canonical pathway in both Jo-1 and IBM was oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We identified 731 known and 325 novel lncRNAs in the muscles biopsies. Comparison with controls showed 55 and 46 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in IBM and Jo-1 myositis, respectively. Of these, 16 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in both IBM and Jo-1 myositis and included upregulated H19, lncMyoD and MALAT1. Given that these are known to regulate muscle proliferation and differentiation, we speculate that changes in lncRNAs might contribute to the phenotypic changes in Jo-1 and IBM myositis.</AbstractText> "

Cell lysates were also analyzed for NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and STAT3 phosphorylation, and supernatants for cytokine production. Coding and regulatory regions in the <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene and other auto-inflammation-implicated genes were sequenced by next-generation sequencing and variants identified.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Mean TNFAIP3 was significantly lower in spondyloarthritis macrophages than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0085). Spondyloarthritis subject macrophages correspondingly produced more TNF-α in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, <i>p</i> = 0.015). Subjects with the highest TNFAIP3 produced significantly less TNF-α in response to LPS (<i>p</i> = 0.0023). Within AxSpA subjects, those on TNF blockers or with shorter duration of disease expressed lower levels of TNFAIP3 (<i>p</i> = 0.0011 and 0.0030, respectively). TNFAIP3 expression correlated positively with phosphorylated IκBα, phosphorylated MAP kinases, and unstimulated phosphorylated STAT3, but negatively with LPS or TNF-α-stimulated fold induction of phosphorylated STAT3. Further, subjects with specific groups of variants within <i>TNFAIP3</i> displayed differences in TNFAIP3 (<i>p</i> = 0.03-0.004). Nominal pQTL associations with genetic variants outside <i>TNFAIP3</i> were identified.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results suggest that both immune functional and genetic variations contribute to the regulation of TNFAIP3 levels in individual subjects. Decreased expression of TNFAIP3 in AxSpA macrophages correlated with increased LPS-induced TNF-α, and thus, TNFAIP3 dysregulation may be a contributor to excessive inflammatory responses in spondyloarthritis subjects.</AbstractText> "

To detect novel risk genes, and to predict an individual's SLE risk we designed a random forest classifier using SNP genotype data generated on the &quot;Immunochip&quot; from 1,160 patients with SLE and 2,711 controls. Using gene importance scores defined by the random forest classifier, we identified 15 potential novel risk genes for SLE. Of them 12 are associated with other autoimmune diseases than SLE, whereas three genes (ZNF804A, CDK1, and MANF) have not previously been associated with autoimmunity. Random forest classification also allowed prediction of patients at risk for lupus nephritis with an area under the curve of 0.94. By allele-specific gene expression analysis we detected cis-regulatory SNPs that affect the expression levels of six of the top 40 genes designed by the random forest analysis, indicating a regulatory role for the identified risk variants. The 40 top genes from the prediction were overrepresented for differential expression in B and T cells according to RNA-sequencing of samples from five healthy donors, with more frequent over-expression in B cells compared to T cells.</AbstractText> "

However, a large proportion of patients need additional treatment with a biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) to adequately suppress their disease activity. A better understanding of genotypes could help to distinguish between patients with different pathogenic mechanisms. The aim of this study was therefore to identify networks of genes within DMARD-naive early RA patients associated with achieving sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after initiating tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, or methotrexate therapy.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Samples were used from 60 patients from the U-Act-Early study who received tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, or methotrexate therapy, and who achieved sDFR (≥3 months in drug-free remission until the end of the study, n = 37) after therapy was tapered and subsequently stopped, or who were not able to discontinue the therapy as controls (n = 23). Whole blood samples were collected and ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from positive cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4<sup>+</sup>) and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells and analysed using high-throughput sequencing. Weighted gene co-expression network analyses were performed to identify clusters (i.e. modules) of differently expressed genes associated with achieving sDFR and which were subsequently used for pathway analyses.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Network analyses within CD4<sup>+</sup> cells identified two significant modules in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm and four modules in the tocilizumab and methotrexate arms, respectively (p ≤ 0.039). Important pathways in the module best correlating with achieving sDFR were in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm related to processes involved with transcription and translation; in the tocilizumab arm, pathways were related to migration of white blood cells and G-protein coupled receptors, and in the methotrexate arm pathways were involved with the response to a bacterial or biotic (i.e. biological material)-related stimulus.

MHC class II expression was studied by immunostainings on eye cryosections. For flow cytometry (FC) analysis, retinas were dissected and enzymatically digested into single-cell suspensions. Three MHC class II<sup>+</sup> retinal cell populations were sorted by FC, and their RNA processed for RNA-Seq.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Immunostainings demonstrate strong induction of MHC class II expression in EAU, especially in the inner retina at the level of inflamed vessels, extending to the outer retinal layers and the subretinal space in severely inflamed eyes. Most MHC class II<sup>+</sup> cells express the hematopoietic marker IBA1. FC quantitative analyses demonstrate that MHC class II induction significantly correlates with disease severity and is associated with upregulation of co-stimulatory molecule expression. In particular, most MHC class II<sup>hi</sup> cells express co-stimulatory molecules during EAU. Further phenotyping identified three MHC class II<sup>+</sup> retinal cell populations: CD45<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>-</sup> non-hematopoietic cells with low MHC class II expression and CD45<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic cells with higher MHC class II expression, which can be further separated into Ly6C<sup>+</sup> and Ly6C<sup>-</sup> cells, possibly corresponding to infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia. Transcriptome analysis of the three sorted populations leads to a clear sample clustering with some enrichment in macrophage markers and microglial cell markers in Ly6C<sup>+</sup> and Ly6C<sup>-</sup> cells, respectively. Functional annotation analysis reveals that both hematopoietic cell populations are more competent in MHC class II-associated antigen presentation and in T cell activation than non-hematopoietic cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our results highlight the potential of cells of hematopoietic origin in local antigen presentation, whatever their Ly6C expression.

"512";"28708839";"Tumor Necrosis Factor dynamically regulates the mRNA stabilome in rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes.";" <AbstractText>During rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) activates fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) inducing in a temporal order a constellation of genes, which perpetuate synovial inflammation. Although the molecular mechanisms regulating TNF-induced transcription are well characterized, little is known about the impact of mRNA stability on gene expression and the impact of TNF on decay rates of mRNA transcripts in FLS. To address these issues we performed RNA sequencing and genome-wide analysis of the mRNA stabilome in RA FLS. We found that TNF induces a biphasic gene expression program: initially, the inducible transcriptome consists primarily of unstable transcripts but progressively switches and becomes dominated by very stable transcripts. This temporal switch is due to: a) TNF-induced prolonged stabilization of previously unstable transcripts that enables progressive transcript accumulation over days and b) sustained expression and late induction of very stable transcripts. TNF-induced mRNA stabilization in RA FLS occurs during the late phase of TNF response, is MAPK-dependent, and involves several genes with pathogenic potential such as IL6, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL8/IL8, CCL2, and PTGS2. These results provide the first insights into genome-wide regulation of mRNA stability in RA FLS and highlight the potential contribution of dynamic regulation of the mRNA stabilome by TNF to chronic synovitis.</AbstractText> "

The histological changes in the posterior segment of the eyes were evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. A high throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) strategy using the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform was applied to characterize the retinal transcriptome profile from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated and untreated mice. The validation of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was analyzed with real-time PCR.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">At the 24th hour after challenge, the clinical score of the LPS group was significantly higher (3.83±0.75, mean ± standard deviation [SD]) than that of the control group (0.08±0.20, mean ± SD; p&lt;0.001). The histological evaluation showed a large number of inflammatory cells infiltrated into the vitreous cavity in the LPS group compared with the control group. A total of 478 DEGs were identified with RNA-seq. Among these genes, 406 were upregulated and 72 were downregulated in the LPS group. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment showed three significantly enriched upregulated terms. Twenty-one upregulated and seven downregulated pathways were remarkably enriched by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Eleven inflammatory response-, complement system-, fibrinolytic system-, and cell stress-related genes were validated to show similar results as the RNA-seq.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We first reported the retinal transcriptome profile of the EIU mouse with RNA-seq. The results indicate that the abnormal changes in the inflammatory response-, complement system-, fibrinolytic system-, and cell stress-related genes occurred concurrently in EIU.

Thirty six Yucatan minipigs underwent anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) transection and were randomly assigned in equal numbers to no further treatment, reconstruction or ligament repair. Cartilage was harvested at 1 and 4 weeks post-operatively and histology and RNA-sequencing were performed and compared to controls. Microscopic cartilage scores significantly worsened at 1 (p = 0.028) and 4 weeks (p = 0.001) post-surgery relative to controls, but did not differ between untreated, reconstruction or repair groups. Gene expression after ACL reconstruction and ACL transection were similar, with only 0.03% (including SERPINB7 and CR2) and 0.2% of transcripts (including INHBA) differentially expressed at 1 and 4 weeks respectively. COL2A1, COMP, SPARC, CHAD, and EF1ALPHA were the most highly expressed non ribosomal, non mitochondrial genes in the controls and remained abundant after surgery. A total of 1,275 genes were differentially expressed between 1 and 4 weeks post-surgery. With the treatment groups pooled, 682 genes were differentially expressed at both time-points, with the most significant changes observed in MMP1, COCH, POSTN, CYTL1, and PTGFR. This study confirmed the development of a microscopic PTOA stage after ACL surgery in the porcine model. Upregulation of multiple proteases (including MMP1 and ADAMTS4) were found; however, the level of expression remained orders of magnitude below that of extracellular matrix protein-coding genes (including COL2A1 and ACAN).

Although these mutations occur in all proliferating cells, their accumulation under non-malignant conditions, such as in autoimmune disorders, has not been investigated. Here, we show that patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis have expanded CD8+ T-cell clones; in 20% (5/25) of patients CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, harbour somatic mutations. In healthy controls (n=20), only one mutation is identified in the CD8+ T-cell pool. Mutations exist exclusively in the expanded CD8+ effector-memory subset, persist during follow-up, and are predicted to change protein functions. Some of the mutated genes (SLAMF6, IRF1) have previously been associated with autoimmunity. RNA sequencing of mutation-harbouring cells shows signatures corresponding to cell proliferation. Our data provide evidence of accumulation of somatic mutations in expanded CD8+ T cells, which may have pathogenic significance for RA and other autoimmune diseases.</AbstractText> "

It is a complex disease affecting the whole joint but is generally characterized by progressive degradation of articular cartilage. Recent genome-wide association screens have implicated distinct DNA methylation signatures in OA patients. We show that the de novo DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 3b, but not Dnmt3a, is present in healthy murine and human articular chondrocytes and its expression decreases in OA mouse models and in chondrocytes from human OA patients. Targeted deletion of Dnmt3b in murine articular chondrocytes results in an early-onset and progressive postnatal OA-like pathology. RNA-Seq and methylC-Seq analyses of Dnmt3b loss-of-function chondrocytes show that cellular metabolic processes are affected. Specifically, TCA metabolites and mitochondrial respiration are elevated. Importantly, a chondroprotective effect was found following Dnmt3b gain of function in murine articular chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo. This study shows that Dnmt3b plays a significant role in regulating postnatal articular cartilage homeostasis.

Although the carrier frequency of specific disease variants in the MEFV gene has been reported from isolated studies, a comprehensive view of variants in the Mediterranean region has not been possible due to paucity of data. The recent availability of whole-genome and whole-exome datasets prompted us to study the genetic epidemiology of MEFV variants in the region. We assembled data from 5 datasets encompassing whole-genome and whole-exome datasets for 2115 individuals from multiple subpopulations in the region and also created a compendium for MEFV genetic variants, which were further systematically annotated as per the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Our analysis points to significant differences in allele frequencies in the subpopulations, and the carrier frequency for MEFV genetic variants in the population to be about 8%. The MEFV gene appears to be under natural selection from our analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study and analysis of population epidemiology of MEFV gene variants in the Middle East and North African populations.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

"518";"28584005";"Neutrophils Slow Disease Progression in Murine Lupus via Modulation of Autoreactive Germinal Centers.";" <AbstractText>Neutrophils are well characterized as mediators of peripheral tissue damage in lupus, but it remains unclear whether they influence loss of self-tolerance in the adaptive immune compartment. Lupus neutrophils produce elevated levels of factors known to fuel autoantibody production, including IL-6 and B cell survival factors, but also reactive oxygen intermediates, which can suppress lymphocyte proliferation. To assess whether neutrophils directly influence the progression of autoreactivity in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), we characterized the localization and cell-cell contacts of splenic neutrophils at several stages in the progression of disease in the NZB/W murine model of lupus. Neutrophils accumulate in SLO over the course of lupus progression, preferentially localizing near T lymphocytes early in disease and B cells with advanced disease. RNA sequencing reveals that the splenic neutrophil transcriptional program changes significantly over the course of disease, with neutrophil expression of anti-inflammatory mediators peaking during early-stage and midstage disease, and evidence of neutrophil activation with advanced disease. To assess whether neutrophils exert predominantly protective or deleterious effects on loss of B cell self-tolerance in vivo, we depleted neutrophils at different stages of disease. Neutrophil depletion early in lupus resulted in a striking acceleration in the onset of renal disease, SLO germinal center formation, and autoreactive plasma cell production. In contrast, neutrophil depletion with more advanced disease did not alter systemic lupus erythematosus progression. These results demonstrate a surprising temporal and context-dependent role for neutrophils in restraining autoreactive B cell activation in lupus.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

"520";"28572608";"Genetic insights into juvenile idiopathic arthritis derived from deep whole genome sequencing.";" <AbstractText>Deep whole genome sequencing (WGS) allows for the comprehensive study of genetic landscapes at finer resolution than array based methods. We conducted deep WGS on children with the polyarticular form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), using 2 independent cohorts to ascertain the sequencing fidelity. Genome wide SNP density analysis identified 18 SNP hotspots with comparison to the 1000 Genome Projects (1KGP) data. A subset of the genes adjacent to SNP hotspots showed statistically significant enrichment in immunological processes. Genes adjacent to indel hotspots were functionally related to G-protein coupled signaling pathways. Further analyses elucidated significantly more JIA SNPs with regulatory potential compared to 1KGP data. Furthermore, SNPs located within linkage disequibilium (LD) blocks containing previously identified JIA-associated SNPs demonstrated higher regulation potential compared to SNPs outside LD blocks. We also demonstrated enrichment of novel JIA variants in histone modification peaks and DNase hypersensitivity sites in B cells. This study greatly expands the number of genetic variants that may contribute to JIA and give us some clues into what may trigger this disease. To date, this study is the first deep WGS effort on children with JIA and provides useful genetic resources for research communities particularly in understanding JIA etiology.</AbstractText> "

We have established a cohort of women with RA and healthy women followed prospectively from a pre-pregnancy baseline. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pregnancy-induced changes in gene expression among women with RA who improve during pregnancy (pregDAS<sub>improved</sub>) overlap substantially with changes observed among healthy women and differ from changes observed among women with RA who worsen during pregnancy (pregDAS<sub>worse</sub>).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Global gene expression profiles were generated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from 11 women with RA and 5 healthy women before pregnancy (T0) and at the third trimester (T3). Among the women with RA, eight showed an improvement in disease activity by T3, whereas three worsened. Differential expression analysis was used to identify genes demonstrating significant changes in expression within each of the RA and healthy groups (T3 vs T0), as well as between the groups at each time point. Gene set enrichment was assessed in terms of Gene Ontology processes and protein networks.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 1296 genes were differentially expressed between T3 and T0 among the 8 pregDAS<sub>improved</sub> women, with 161 genes showing at least two-fold change (FC) in expression by T3. The majority (108 of 161 genes) were also differentially expressed among healthy women (q&lt;0.05, FC≥2). Additionally, a small cluster of genes demonstrated contrasting changes in expression between the pregDAS<sub>improved</sub> and pregDAS<sub>worse</sub> groups, all of which were inducible by type I interferon (IFN). These IFN-inducible genes were over-expressed at T3 compared to the T0 baseline among the pregDAS<sub>improved</sub> women.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In our pilot RNA-seq dataset, increased pregnancy-induced expression of type I IFN-inducible genes was observed among women with RA who improved during pregnancy, but not among women who worsened. These findings warrant further investigation into expression of these genes in RA pregnancy and their potential role in modulation of disease activity. These results are nevertheless preliminary and should be interpreted with caution until replicated in a larger sample.</AbstractText> "

Protein and gene expression, cytokine profile, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and presence of low-density granulocytes were evaluated in patient primary cells and serum samples.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We identified a novel, homozygous, loss-of-function mutation (p.Pro445Leufs*11) in the C1R gene. Using the Sanger method of DNA sequencing in 14 family members, we confirmed the presence of the mutation in 4 patients with SLE and in an asymptomatic 9-year-old girl. Complement levels were low in sera from patients with truncated C1r protein. Two siblings with SLE who were available for detailed evaluation exhibited strong type I interferon (IFN) inflammatory signatures despite their disease being clinically inactive at the time of sampling. The type I IFN transcriptional signature in the patients' blood correlated with disease expressivity, whereas the neutrophil signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was likely associated with disease severity. The female patient with SLE with the most severe phenotype presented with a stronger neutrophil signature, defined by enhanced NET formation and the presence of low-density granulocytes. Analysis of exome data for modifying alleles suggested enrichment of common SLE-associated variants in the more severely affected patients. Lupus-associated HLA alleles or HLA haplotypes were not shared among the 4 affected subjects.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our findings revealed a novel high-penetrance mutation in C1R as the cause of monogenic SLE.

PTEN is a regulator of growth and homeostasis in immune system cells, although there are limited data describing immune dysregulation caused by <i>PTEN</i> mutations. We describe a case of PHTS syndrome caused by a de novo mutation in <i>PTEN</i> detected using a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel which was instigated for workup of cutaneous vasculitis.

"526";"28500073";"FcγRIIIa Signaling Modulates Endosomal TLR Responses in Human CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells.";" <AbstractText>Recognition of Ab-opsonized pathogens by immune cells triggers both TLR and Fc receptor signaling. Fc receptors endocytose modified nucleic acids bound to Abs and deliver them to endosomes, where they are recognized by nucleic acid-sensing TLRs (NA-TLRs). We show that in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, NA-TLRs, TLR3, TLR8, and TLR9 are upregulated by FcγRIIIa-pSyk cosignaling and localize with FcγRIIIa on the cell surface. TLR9 accumulates on the cell surface, where it recognizes CpG oligonucleotide 2006. Subcellular location of NA-TLRs is a key determinant in discriminating self versus viral nucleic acid. Hydroxychloroquine used for treating systemic lupus erythematosus and a Syk inhibitor blocked NA-TLR localization with FcγRIIIa. Engaging TLR9 with CpG oligonucleotide contributes to the development of IL17A<sup>+</sup> and IL-21<sup>+</sup> populations. RNA-sequencing analysis showed upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, NF-κB signaling, and heat shock protein pathway RNA transcripts. These data suggest a role for FcγRIIIa-pSyk cosignaling in modulating NA-TLR responses in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by affecting the amounts and cellular distribution.

Our aim was to identify coding mutations of FPF-risk genes associated with RA-ILD.We used whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by restricted analysis of a discrete number of FPF-linked genes and performed a burden test to assess the excess number of mutations in RA-ILD patients compared to controls.Among the 101 RA-ILD patients included, 12 (11.9%) had 13 WES-identified heterozygous mutations in the <i>TERT</i>, <i>RTEL1</i>, <i>PARN</i> or <i>SFTPC</i> coding regions<i>.</i> The burden test, based on 81 RA-ILD patients and 1010 controls of European ancestry, revealed an excess of <i>TERT</i>, <i>RTEL1</i>, <i>PARN</i> or <i>SFTPC</i> mutations in RA-ILD patients (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.53-6.12; p=9.45×10<sup>-4</sup>).

"528";"28495399";"Evaluation of Toll-like-receptor gene family variants as prognostic biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis.";" <AbstractText>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease whose main feature is persistent joint inflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and influence the activity of NFκB, a key player in chronic inflammation. We aimed at investigating the association of TLR allelic variants with susceptibility and severity of RA through a systematic, high-throughput, analysis of TLR genes. All coding exons and flanking regions of nine members of the TLR family (TLR1-9) were analyzed in 66 patients with RA and 30 healthy controls by next generation sequencing. We focussed on three single allelic variants, N248S in TLR1, Q11L in TLR7 and M1V in TLR8 based on the allelic frequencies in both patient and control populations, the predicted impact on protein function and the novelty in RA research. Analysis of these selected variants in a larger cohort of 402 patients with RA and in 208 controls revealed no association with susceptibility. However, the M1V allele was associated with a lower need for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (p=0.008) and biologic treatments (p=0.021). Functional studies showed that the M1V variant leads to a reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα, in response to TLR8 agonists. Thus, the presence of this variant confers a significant protective effect on disease severity. These results show for the first time the association between the M1V variant of TLR8 and reduced disease severity in RA, which could have prognostic value for these patients.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017.

Pharmacogenetic studies attempt to discover and estimate the contributions of genetic variants to the variability in response to a drug treatment. The task of identifying the genetic contribution is often complicated by response phenotypes that are based on imprecise or subjective clinical observations. Because the success of a pharmacogenetic study depends on the analysis of a heritable phenotype, it is important to identify phenotypes with a significant heritable component to ensure reliable and reproducible results in subsequent genetic association studies.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We retrospectively analyzed data collected from 436 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with golimumab during the phase III GO-FURTHER study. We investigated the reliability of several potential response outcomes after golimumab treatment. Using whole-genome sequencing of the clinical trial cohort, we estimated the heritability of each potential outcome measure. We further performed a longitudinal analysis of the clinical data to estimate variability of outcome measures over time and the degree to which each response metric could be confounded by placebo response.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We determined that the high degree of within-patient variation over time makes a single follow-up visit insufficient to assess an individual patient's response to golimumab treatment. We found that different potential response outcomes had varying degrees of heritability and that averaging across multiple follow-up visits yielded higher heritability estimates than single follow-up estimates. Importantly, we found that the change in swollen and tender joint counts were the most heritable outcome metrics we tested; however, we showed that they are also more likely to be confounded by a placebo response than objective phenotypes like the change in C-reactive protein levels.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our rigorous approach to finding robust and heritable response phenotypes could be beneficial to all pharmacogenetic studies and may lead to more reliable and reproducible results.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00973479 .

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a potential solution to dissect the heterogeneity of the disease and enables the study of similar cell types distant from the site of renal injury to identify novel biomarkers. We applied scRNA-seq to human renal and skin biopsy tissues and demonstrated that scRNA-seq can be performed on samples obtained during routine care. Chronicity index, IgG deposition, and quantity of proteinuria correlated with a transcriptomic-based score composed of IFN-inducible genes in renal tubular cells. Furthermore, analysis of cumulative expression profiles of single cell keratinocytes dissociated from nonlesional, non-sun-exposed skin of patients with lupus nephritis also revealed upregulation of IFN-inducible genes compared with keratinocytes isolated from healthy controls. This indicates the possible use of scRNA-seq analysis of skin biopsies as a biomarker of renal disease. These data support the potential utility of scRNA-seq to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and pave the way for exploiting a readily accessible tissue to reflect injury in the kidney.</AbstractText> "

In this study, we report that decreased microRNA (miR)-200a-3p causes IL-2 hypoproduction through zinc finger E-box binding homeobox (ZEB)1 and C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) in a lupus-prone mouse. First, we performed RNA sequencing to identify candidate microRNAs and mRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. We found that miR-200a-3p was significantly downregulated, whereas its putative targets, ZEB2 and CtBP2, were upregulated in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from MRL/lpr-<i>Tnfrsf6</i><sup>lpr</sup> mice compared with C57BL/6J mice. ZEB1 and ZEB2 comprise the ZEB family and suppress various genes, including IL-2 by recruiting CtBP2. IL-2 plays a critical role in immune tolerance, and insufficient IL-2 production upon stimulation has been recognized in SLE pathogenesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that decreased miR-200a-3p causes IL-2 deficit through the ZEB1-CtBP2 and/or ZEB2-CtBP2 complex in SLE CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Overexpression of miR-200a-3p induced IL-2 production by downregulating ZEB1, ZEB2, and CtBP2 in EL4 cell lines. We further revealed that miR-200a-3p promotes IL-2 expression by reducing the binding of suppressive ZEB1-CtBP2 and ZEB2-CtBP2 complexes on negative regulatory element A in the IL-2 promoter in EL4 cells. Interestingly, the ZEB1-CtBP2 complex on negative regulatory element A was significantly upregulated after PMA/ionomycin stimulation in lupus CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our studies have revealed a new epigenetic pathway in the control of IL-2 production in SLE whereby low levels of miR-200a-3p accumulate the binding of the ZEB1-CtBP2 complex to the IL-2 promoter and suppress IL-2 production.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

The first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP I) is highly susceptible to development of OA due to repetitive mechanical stress during walking. We used whole exome sequencing to study genetic defect(s) predisposing to familial early-onset bilateral MTP I OA inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant rs41310883 (c.524C&gt;T, p.Thr175Met) in TUFT1 gene was found to co-segregate perfectly with MTP I OA. The role of TUFT1 and the relevance of the identified variant in pathogenesis of MTP I OA were further assessed using functional in vitro analyses. The variant reduced TUFT1 mRNA and tuftelin protein expression in HEK293 cells. ATDC5 cells overexpressing wild type (wt) or mutant TUFT1 were cultured in calcifying conditions and chondrogenic differentiation was found to be inhibited in both cell populations, as indicated by decreased marker gene expression when compared with the empty vector control cells. Also, the formation of cartilage nodules was diminished in both TUFT1 overexpressing ATDC5 cell populations. At the end of the culturing period the calcium content of the extracellular matrix was significantly increased in cells overexpressing mutant TUFT1 compared to cells overexpressing wt TUFT1 and control cells, while the proteoglycan content was reduced. These data imply that overexpression of TUFT1 in ATDC5 inhibits chondrogenic differentiation, and the identified variant may contribute to the pathogenesis of OA by increasing calcification and reducing amount of proteoglycans in the articular cartilage extracellular matrix thus making cartilage susceptible for degeneration and osteophyte formation.</AbstractText> "

We identified differentially methylated (using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array) and expressed (using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA-seq protocol) sites between cases and controls, and investigated the biological significance of this SARD signature using gene annotation databases. We recruited 13 seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, 19 systemic sclerosis, 12 systemic lupus erythematosus subjects, and 8 healthy controls. We identified 33 genes that were both differentially methylated and expressed (26 over- and 7 under-expressed) in SARD cases versus controls. The most highly overexpressed gene was CD1C (log fold change in expression = 1.85, adjusted P value = 0.009). In functional analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis), the top network identified was lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry. The top canonical pathways included the mitochondrial L-carnitine shuttle pathway (P = 5E-03) and PTEN signaling (P = 8E-03). The top upstream regulator was HNF4A (P = 3E-05). This novel SARD signature contributes to ongoing work to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SARD and provides novel targets of interest.</AbstractText> "

Samples from patients with Still's disease and bacterial infections were used also.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The stress-related protein regulated in development and DNA damage responses 1 (REDD1) is significantly overexpressed during FMF attacks. Neutrophils from patients with FMF during remission are resistant to autophagy-mediated NET release, which can be overcome through REDD1 induction. Stress-related mediators (eg, epinephrine) decrease this threshold, leading to autophagy-driven NET release, whereas the synchronous inflammatory environment of FMF attack leads to intracellular production of IL-1β and its release through NETs. REDD1 in autolysosomes colocalizes with pyrin and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat/pyrin domain-containing 3. Mutated pyrin prohibits this colocalization, leading to higher IL-1β levels on NETs.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study provides a link between stress and initiation of inflammatory attacks in patients with FMF. REDD1 emerges as a regulator of neutrophil function upstream to pyrin, is involved in NET release and regulation of IL-1β, and might constitute an important piece in the IL-1β-mediated inflammation puzzle.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.

"537";"28339495";"MicroRNA expression profiles identify disease-specific alterations in systemic lupus erythematosus and primary Sjögren's syndrome.";" <AbstractText>The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their critical role in genetic control opened new avenues in understanding of various biological processes including immune cell lineage commitment, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. However, a given miRNA may have hundreds of different mRNA targets and a target might be regulated by multiple miRNAs, thus the characterisation of dysregulated miRNA expression profiles could give a better insight into the development of immunological disturbances in autoimmune diseases. The aim of our study was to examine the changes in miRNA expression profiles in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Eight SLE patients, 8 pSS patients and 7 healthy subjects were enrolled in the investigation. MiRNAs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and expression patterns were determined with Illumina next-generation sequencing technology. Since the immunopathogenesis of pSS and SLE encompasses pronounced B cell hyperactivity along with specific autoantibody production, we paid a special attention on the association between miRNA expression levels and altered peripheral B cell distribution. In SLE patients 135, while in pSS patients 26 miRNAs showed altered expression. Interestingly, the 25 miRNAs including miR-146a, miR-16 and miR-21, which were over-expressed in pSS patients, were found to be elevated in SLE group, as well. On the contrary, we observed the down-regulation of miR-150-5p, which is a novel and unique finding in pSS. Levels of several miRNAs over-expressed in SLE, were not changed in pSS, such as miR-148a-3p, miR-152, miR-155, miR-223, miR-224, miR-326 and miR-342. Expression levels of miR-223-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-342-3p, which miRNAs are potentially linked to B cell functions, showed associations with the B cell proportions within peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The observed differences in miRNA expression profiles and the better understanding of immune regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of SLE and pSS.</AbstractText> "
"538";"28333140";"Metabolic and molecular insights into an essential role of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.";" <AbstractText>Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a pleiotropic protein implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome, aging, cancer, coronary heart diseases, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of NAMPT in these physiological and pathological processes are not fully understood. Here, we provide experimental evidence that a Nampt gene homozygous knockout (Nampt<sup>-/-</sup>) resulted in lethality at an early stage of mouse embryonic development and death within 5-10 days in adult mice accompanied by a 25.24±2.22% body weight loss, after the tamoxifen induction of Nampt<sup>F/F</sup> × Cre mice. These results substantiate that Nampt is an essential gene for life. In Nampt<sup>-/-</sup> mice versus Nampt<sup>+/+</sup> mice, biochemical assays indicated that liver and intestinal tissue NAD levels were decreased significantly; histological examination showed that mouse intestinal villi were atrophic and disrupted, and visceral fat was depleted; mass spectrometry detected unusual higher serum polyunsaturated fatty acid containing triglycerides. RNA-seq analyses of both mouse and human pediatric liver transcriptomes have convergently revealed that NAMPT is involved in key basic cellular functions such as transcription, translation, cell signaling, and fundamental metabolism. Notably, the expression of all eight enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were decreased significantly in the Nampt<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These findings prompt us to posit that adult Nampt<sup>-/-</sup> mouse lethality is a result of a short supply of ATP from compromised intestinal absorption of nutrients from digested food, which leads to the exhaustion of body fat stores.</AbstractText> "

Perturbed myocellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) homeostasis can exacerbate many of the factors proposed to mediate muscle degeneration in IBM, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation may plausibly be initiated in IBM by immune-mediated membrane damage and/or abnormally accumulating proteins, but no studies to date have investigated Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in IBM patients. We first investigated protein expression via immunoblot in muscle biopsies from IBM, dermatomyositis, and non-myositis control patients, identifying several differentially expressed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulatory proteins in IBM. Next, we investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling transcriptome by RNA-seq, finding 54 of 183 (29.5%) genes from an unbiased list differentially expressed in IBM vs. controls. Using an established statistical approach to relate genes with causal transcription networks, Ca<sup>2+</sup> abundance was considered a significant upstream regulator of observed whole-transcriptome changes. Post-hoc analyses of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulatory mRNA and protein data indicated a lower protein to transcript ratio in IBM vs. controls, which we hypothesized may relate to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent proteolysis and decreased protein translation. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed robust (4-fold) elevation in the autolytic activation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated protease, calpain-1, as well as increased signaling for translational attenuation (eIF2a phosphorylation) downstream of the unfolded protein response. Finally, in IBM samples we observed mRNA and protein under-expression of calpain-3, the skeletal muscle-specific calpain, which broadly supports proper Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Together, these data provide novel insight into mechanisms by which intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation is perturbed in IBM and offer evidence of pathological downstream effects.</AbstractText> "

We discovered two rare signals that strongly associate with osteoarthritis total hip replacement: a missense variant, c.1141G&gt;C (p.Asp369His), in the COMP gene (allelic frequency = 0.026%, P = 4.0 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, odds ratio (OR) = 16.7) and a frameshift mutation, rs532464664 (p.Val330Glyfs*106), in the CHADL gene that associates through a recessive mode of inheritance (homozygote frequency = 0.15%, P = 4.5 × 10<sup>-18</sup>, OR = 7.71). On average, c.1141G&gt;C heterozygotes and individuals homozygous for rs532464664 had their hip replacement operation 13.5 years and 4.9 years earlier than others (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0026), respectively. We show that the full-length CHADL transcript is expressed in cartilage. Furthermore, the premature stop codon introduced by the CHADL frameshift mutation results in nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant transcripts.</AbstractText> "

To gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, we studied known JIA genetic risk loci, the majority of which are located in non-coding regions, where transcription is regulated and coordinated on a genome-wide basis. We examined human neutrophils and CD4 primary T cells to identify genes and functional elements located within those risk loci.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We analyzed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, and previously published chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) data to characterize the chromatin landscapes within the known JIA-associated risk loci.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In both neutrophils and primary CD4+ T cells, the majority of the JIA-associated linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks contained H3K27ac and/or H3K4me1 marks. These LD blocks were also binding sites for a small group of transcription factors, particularly in neutrophils. Furthermore, these regions showed abundant intronic and intergenic transcription in neutrophils. In neutrophils, none of the genes that were differentially expressed between untreated patients with JIA and healthy children were located within the JIA-risk LD blocks.

Recent studies identified an association between a rare missense single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the ALDH16A1 gene and elevated serum uric acid levels and gout. The present study explores the mechanisms by which ALDH16A1 influences uric acid homeostasis in the kidney. We generated and validated a mouse line with global disruption of the Aldh16a1 gene through gene targeting and performed RNA-seq analyses in the kidney of wild-type (WT) and Aldh16a1 knockout (KO) mice, along with plasma metabolomics. We found that ALDH16A1 is expressed in proximal and distal convoluted tubule cells in the cortex of the kidney and in zone 3 hepatocytes. RNA-seq and gene ontology enrichment analyses showed that cellular lipid and lipid metabolic processes are up-regulated. Three transporters localized in the apical membrane of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney known to influence urate/uric acid homeostasis were found to be up-regulated (Abcc4, Slc16a9) or down-regulated (Slc17a3). An initial metabolomics analysis in plasma revealed an altered lipid profile in KO mice that is in agreement with our RNA-seq analysis. This is the first study demonstrating a functional role of ALDH16A1 in the kidney.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation> "

Previous studies showed that these two diseases had a common pathogenesis, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was employed to explore both the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of 10 PS and 10 RA patients compared with those of 10 healthy volunteers and the shared DEGs between these two diseases. Bioinformatics network analysis was used to reveal the connections among the shared DEGs and the corresponding molecular mechanism. In total, 120 and 212 DEGs were identified in PS and RA, respectively, and 31 shared DEGs were identified. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the cytokine imbalance relevant to key molecules (such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3), interleukin- (IL-) 6, and interferon gene (IFNG)) and canonical signaling pathways (such as the complement system, antigen presentation, macropinocytosis signaling, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-<i>κ</i>B) signaling, and IL-17 signaling) was responsible for the common comprehensive mechanism of PS and RA. Our findings provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PS and RA, suggesting potential strategies for treating and preventing both diseases.

"546";"28235825";"Genome-Wide Screen Reveals <i>sec21</i> Mutants of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Are Methotrexate-Resistant.";" <AbstractText>Drug resistance is a consequence of how most modern medicines work. Drugs exert pressure on cells that causes death or the evolution of resistance. Indeed, highly specific drugs are rendered ineffective by a single DNA mutation. In this study, we apply the drug methotrexate, which is widely used in cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, and perform evolution experiments on Baker's yeast to ask the different ways in which cells become drug resistant. Because of the conserved nature of biological pathways between yeast and man, our results can inform how the same mechanism may operate to render human cells resistant to treatment. Exposure of cells to small molecules and drug therapies imposes a strong selective pressure. As a result, cells rapidly acquire mutations in order to survive. These include resistant variants of the drug target as well as those that modulate drug transport and detoxification. To systematically explore how cells acquire drug resistance in an unbiased manner, rapid cost-effective approaches are required. Methotrexate, as one of the first rationally designed anticancer drugs, has served as a prototypic example of such acquired resistance. Known methotrexate resistance mechanisms include mutations that increase expression of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) target as well as those that maintain function yet reduce the drug's binding affinity. Recent evidence suggests that target-independent, epistatic mutations can also result in resistance to methotrexate. Currently, however, the relative contribution of such unlinked resistance mutations is not well understood. To address this issue, we took advantage of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as a model eukaryotic system that combined with whole-genome sequencing and a rapid screening methodology, allowed the identification of causative mutations that modulate resistance to methotrexate. We found a recurrent missense mutation in <i>SEC21</i> (orthologous to human COPG1), which we confirmed in 10 <i>de novo</i> methotrexate-resistant strains. This <i>sec21</i> allele (S96L) behaves as a recessive, gain-of-function allele, conferring methotrexate resistance that is abrogated by the presence of a wild-type copy of <i>SEC21</i> These observations indicate that the Sec21p/COPI transport complex has previously uncharacterized roles in modulating methotrexate stress.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Wong et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

With aging, cachexia, starvation, and myositis, there is a preferential loss of fast glycolytic muscle fibers. We previously reported a mouse model in which a constitutively-active Akt transgene is induced to express in a subset of muscle groups leading to the hypertrophy of type IIb myofibers with an accompanying increase in strength. This muscle growth protects mice in various cardio-metabolic disease models, but little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which fast-twitch muscle impacts disease processes and regulates distant tissues. In the present study, poly (A) + tail mRNA-seq and non-targeted metabolomics were performed to characterize the transcriptome and metabolome of the hypertrophic gastrocnemius muscle from Akt1-transgenic mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Combined metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that Akt1-induced muscle growth mediated a metabolic shift involving reductions in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, but enhanced pentose phosphate pathway activation and increased branch chain amino acid accumulation. Pathway analysis for the 4,027 differentially expressed genes in muscle identified enriched signaling pathways involving growth, cell cycle regulation, and inflammation. Consistent with a regenerative transcriptional signature, the transgenic muscle tissue was found to be comprised of fibers with centralized nuclei that are positive for embryonic myosin heavy chain. Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed the presence of inflammatory cells associated with the regenerating fibers. Signal peptide prediction analysis revealed 240 differentially expressed in muscle transcripts that potentially encode secreted proteins. A number of these secreted factors have signaling properties that are consistent with the myogenic, metabolic and cardiovascular-protective properties that have previously been associated with type IIb muscle growth.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study provides the first extensive transcriptomic sequencing/metabolomics analysis for a model of fast-twitch myofiber growth. These data reveal that enhanced Akt signaling promotes the activation of pathways that are important for the production of proteins and nucleic acids.

Recently, there has been great interest in the use of plant-derived compounds and supplements in managing the symptoms of OA. Arthrocen is a plant-based supplement consisting of avocado and soy unsaponifiable extracts in a 1 : 2 ratio. In an effort to unravel the potential mechanisms of its action on the cellular level, we utilized an <i>in vitro</i> assay to study its effects on cultured human chondrocytes. By pairing this assay with protein arrays on inflammatory markers, RNA-Seq with downstream pathway analysis, and lipidomics on eicosanoids, we were able to further define its action at the molecular level. Specifically, we found a role for Arthrocen in attenuating the inflammatory response both at the protein and mRNA level. Furthermore, we discovered that Arthrocen diminished prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in response to an inflammatory trigger. Additionally, unlike traditional COX-2 inhibitors, this response rather specifically attenuated PGE2 levels in the presence of inflammation and without lowering levels of other eicosanoids. This implies that Arthrocen could potentially bring about the reduced pain produced by COX-2 inhibitors without the known side effects of COX-2 inhibition.</AbstractText> "

Symptoms in variant carriers differed depending on the mutation. Patients harboring a p.I553M variant presented with antibody deficiency, infection susceptibility, and multiorgan autoimmunity. Patients with a p.H67R substitution had antibody deficiency and experienced autoinflammatory episodes, including aphthae, gastrointestinal disease, febrile attacks, and small-vessel vasculitis characteristic of Behçet disease. Patients with a p.R157X stop-gain experienced hyperinflammatory responses to surgery and showed enhanced inflammasome activation. In functional analyses the p.R157X variant caused proteasome-dependent degradation of both the truncated and wild-type proteins, leading to a dramatic loss of p50/p105. The p.H67R variant reduced nuclear entry of p50 and showed decreased transcriptional activity in luciferase reporter assays. The p.I553M mutation in turn showed no change in p50 function but exhibited reduced p105 phosphorylation and stability. Affinity purification mass spectrometry also demonstrated that both missense variants led to altered protein-protein interactions.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings broaden the scope of phenotypes caused by mutations in NFKB1 and suggest that a subset of autoinflammatory diseases, such as Behçet disease, can be caused by rare monogenic variants in genes of the NF-κB pathway.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyse the influence of clinical characteristics on strength and the change in strength over time. Whole exome sequencing was performed in a subset of patients.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"">. Among 50 patients followed for ⩾2 years, only 22 (44%) reached full strength with immunosuppressive therapy; even among those with full strength, 55% continued to have CK levels in excess of 500 IU/l and only three could be tapered off immunosuppressive therapy. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients who were older at disease onset were stronger at all time points (P &lt; 0.001) and improved faster (P &lt; 0.008) than younger patients; a history of statin exposure was not independently associated with the improvement rate. Younger patients were more likely to have refractory disease (P = 0.02) than older patients. Among eight refractory patients with DNA available for testing, whole exome sequencing did not reveal pathogenic mutations in known dystrophy genes. The risk of cancer was not increased in anti-HMGCR myositis patients compared with the general population.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"">Anti-HMGCR myositis is usually a chronic disease requiring long-term immunosuppression.

RNA-Seq has the potential to discover a more comprehensive set of eQTLs and illuminate the underlying molecular consequence. We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) through the integration of GWAS and eQTL data from the TwinsUK microarray and RNA-Seq cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant eQTLs and eGenes. We discovered the greatest frequency of candidate-causal eQTLs using exon-level RNA-Seq, and identified novel SLE susceptibility genes (e.g. NADSYN1 and TCF7) that were concealed using microarrays, including four non-coding RNAs. Many of these eQTLs were found to influence the expression of several genes, supporting the notion that risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. Novel SLE associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, IKZF2, and other candidate genes (e.g. WDFY4) through asQTL mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in SLE by maximising the leverage of RNA-Seq and performing integrative GWAS-eQTL analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. We conclude that to better understand the true functional consequence of regulatory variants, quantification by RNA-Seq should be performed at the exon-level as a minimum, and run in parallel with gene and splice-junction level quantification.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

B-cell receptor (BCR) has a central role in B-cell development, activation, survival and apoptosis, and thus is a critical component of the regulation of both protective and autoreactive B cells. In this study, we applied multiplex PCR and Illumina high-throughput sequencing to study the composition and variation of the BCRs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients and healthy donors (NC). We found that SLE group displayed significantly shorter CDR3 average length (14.86±0.76aa vs 15.70±0.43aa), more arginine percentage of CDR3 amino acids (7.57±0.20% vs 7.32±0.19%) and poorer immunological diversity than the healthy ones. CDR3 sequence YGMDV present in all SLE samples may provide more information in generating more effective B-cell targeted diagnosis/therapies strategies.</AbstractText> "

Clinical features and histopathological changes in dysferlinopathies may mimic inflammatory myopathies and a high degree of clinical suspicion is required to guide the genetic investigation. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 16-year-old male who presented with severe bilateral calf pain and elevated CK levels (15 000 IU/l) who was on prolonged steroid therapy prompted by the clinical suspicion of inflammatory myopathy. Three years into his illness, he was referred for neuromuscular evaluation presenting with untreatable muscle pain and progressive weakness. The diagnosis of &quot;refractory polymyositis&quot; was revisited. Targeted exome sequencing revealed homozygous pathogenic mutations in the DYSF gene, confirming a diagnosis of Miyoshi myopathy. CONCLUSIONS Our case illustrates that severe muscle pain may be the initial feature of Miyoshi myopathy and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory myopathies. Although the described patient reported partial clinical improvement in muscle pain, steroid treatment is not an effective therapy for dysferlinopathy patients and it did not prevent disease progression. In addition, we confirm the utility of next-generation sequencing approaches to myopathies, particularly in complex or unusual cases when muscle biopsy is not available.</AbstractText> "

"561";"29675116";"<i>In Vitro</i> Effects of Arthrocen, an Avocado/Soy Unsaponifiables Agent, on Inflammation and Global Gene Expression in Human Monocytes.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis. Symptomatically characterized by stiffness and pain, OA is a chronic degenerative disease of joints. Of note, there is growing interest in the potential use of plant-based compounds for symptomatic treatment of OA. Arthrocen is a plant-derived agent consisting of a one to two ratio of avocado and soy unsaponifiable extracts. In order to decipher the potential mechanisms of Arthrocen's action at the molecular level, we employed an <i>in vitro</i> assay using cultured human THP-1 cells (a model cell line for monocytes) to study its effects. By pairing protein arrays enriched for inflammatory markers, transcriptomic pathway analysis using RNA-Sequencing, and eicosanoid specific lipidomics, we have begun to unravel its potential mechanism of action. Specifically, we found that Arthrocen can attenuate the inflammatory response at the transcript level while inducing significant changes in numerous cytokines. Furthermore, we discovered that while Arthrocen alone did not increase IL-8 or MCP-1 levels, its presence had a synergistic effect on the observed increase in response to LPS stimulation. Additionally, this synergistic effect of Arthrocen on LPS stimulation of IL-8 and MCP-1 protein levels was also observed at the mRNA level and suggests a regulatory mechanism at the transcriptional level. Interestingly, Arthrocen induced no changes in any of the eicosanoids studied. This multi-omics approach implies that Arthrocen functions at the level of gene transcription to dampen inflammation mediated by monocytes in OA.</AbstractText> "
"562";"28012595";"Orbital autoimmune inflammatory disorders - Protein regional variability might explain specific lesion location.";" <AbstractText>In ophthalmology, inflammatory diseases target different highly specific regions within the small confine of the orbit. Some entities even prefer a particular location or depth within the same tissue (ex. anterior, intermediate or posterior uveitides, chorioretinitides with unique topographic presentations). Though the location of a lesion strongly influences and helps us in our differential diagnosis, we still don't understand why specific anatomic sites are susceptible to a disease while other areas are spared. We postulate that regional variability in tissue protein expression can sway the immune system's capacity to trigger an autoimmune response. In addition to this site-specific quantitative and qualitative variability in potential antigen expression, we believe that other proteins implicated in the immune cascade, as well as geographic areas of relative resistance, tolerance and susceptibility, may be unequally distributed within the orbit. To illustrate our hypotheses, we review three major types of ocular myositis and describe how the extraocular muscles different embryologic origins and protein disparities might explain the fundamental clinical differences between these orbital inflammatory diseases. We hope that future differential genomics, proteinomics, epigenomics and analysis of RNA species of affected tissues, compared to their non-affected, yet microscopically similar, counterparts, will help us understand why diseases occur where they do. Hopefully, understanding these immune triggers will pave the way to new treatment options for ocular inflammatory diseases and for other auto-inflammatory conditions with a marked predilection for any given site.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

"565";"27982725";"Differential analysis of genome-wide methylation and gene expression in mesenchymal stem cells of patients with fractures and osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Insufficient activity of the bone-forming osteoblasts leads to low bone mass and predisposes to fragility fractures. The functional capacity of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), the precursors of osteoblasts, may be compromised in elderly individuals, in relation with the epigenetic changes associated with aging. However, the role of hMSCs in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is still unclear. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the genome-wide methylation and gene expression signatures and the differentiation capacity of hMSCs from patients with hip fractures. We obtained hMSCs from the femoral heads of women undergoing hip replacement due to hip fractures and controls with hip osteoarthritis. DNA methylation was explored with the Infinium 450K bead array. Transcriptome analysis was done by RNA sequencing. The genomic analyses revealed that most differentially methylated loci were situated in genomic regions with enhancer activity, distant from gene bodies and promoters. These regions were associated with differentially expressed genes enriched in pathways related to hMSC growth and osteoblast differentiation. hMSCs from patients with fractures showed enhanced proliferation and upregulation of the osteogenic drivers RUNX2/OSX. Also, they showed some signs of accelerated methylation aging. When cultured in osteogenic medium, hMSCs from patients with fractures showed an impaired differentiation capacity, with reduced alkaline phosphatase activity and poor accumulation of a mineralized matrix. Our results point to 2 areas of potential interest for discovering new therapeutic targets for low bone mass disorders and bone regeneration: the mechanisms stimulating MSCs proliferation after fracture and those impairing their terminal differentiation.</AbstractText> "

Recent studies implicate TonEBP signaling in inflammatory disease and rheumatoid arthritis pathogenesis. However, broader functions of TonEBP in the disc remain unknown. RNA sequencing was performed on NP cells with TonEBP knockdown under hypertonic conditions. 1140 TonEBP-dependent genes were identified and categorized using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Bioinformatic analysis showed enrichment of matrix homeostasis and cytokine/chemokine signaling pathways. C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin 6 (IL6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) were studied further. Knockdown experiments showed that TonEBP was necessary to maintain expression levels of these genes. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that TonEBP binding to a specific site in the CCL2 promoter is required for hypertonic inducibility. Despite inhibition by dominant-negative TonEBP, IL6 and NOS2 promoters were not hypertonicity-inducible. Whole-disc response to hypertonicity was studied in an ex vivo organ culture model, using wild-type and haploinsufficient TonEBP mice. Pro-inflammatory targets were induced by hypertonicity in discs from wild-type but not TonEBP-haploinsufficient mice. Mechanistically, NF-κB activity increased with hypertonicity and was necessary for hypertonic induction of target genes IL6, TNF, and NOS2 but not CCL2 Although TonEBP maintains transcription of genes traditionally considered pro-inflammatory, it is important to note that some of these genes also serve anabolic and pro-survival roles. Therefore, in NP cells, this phenomenon may reflect a physiological adaptation to diurnal osmotic loading of the intervertebral disc.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

Aberrant bone formation is a key feature of pathogenesis that can lead to ankylosis of the spine. Our objective is to determine, whether genes whose variants confer susceptibility to AS are expressed in bone progenitors like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Since MSCs from bone marrow is difficult to obtain, we first examined, whether MSCs can be derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Dermal fibroblasts of two axSpA patients and one healthy control were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a Sendai virus vector encoding pluripotency genes. Pluripotency of iPSCs was examined by embryoid body formation and by testing for stem cell specific gene and protein expression using RT-PCR and immuno fluorescence. iPSCs were differentiated into MSCs by a TGFß inhibitor. MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry using lineage specific antibodies and by their capacity to develop into chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts in lineage-specific medium. RNA-seq was applied to determine genome-wide gene expression patterns in MSCs, iPSCs, and blood. We show for the first time, that expression levels of several AS susceptibility genes (EDIL3, ANO6, HAPLN1, ANTXR2) involved in bone formation are significantly elevated in MSCs (2-15-fold; p ≤ 0.05) compared to blood or iPSCs and demonstrate that iPSC-derived MSCs can be differentiated into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. We conclude, MSCs generated from patient fibroblast-derived iPSC lines are useful tools for studying functional genomics of risk genes associated with bone formation in AS pathogenesis.</AbstractText> "

This suggests the possibility that the lung could be a site of autoimmunity generation in RA, perhaps in response to microbiota changes. We therefore sought to test whether the RA lung microbiome contains distinct taxonomic features associated with local and/or systemic autoimmunity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing was utilized to compare the bacterial community composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) in patients with early, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD)-naïve RA, patients with lung sarcoidosis, and healthy control subjects. Samples were further assessed for the presence and levels of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (including fine specificities) in both BAL and serum.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The BAL microbiota of RA patients was significantly less diverse and abundant when compared to healthy controls, but similar to sarcoidosis patients. This distal airway dysbiosis was attributed to the reduced presence of several genus (i.e., Actynomyces and Burkhordelia) as well as reported periodontopathic taxa, including Treponema, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. While multiple clades correlated with local and systemic levels of autoantibodies, the genus Pseudonocardia and various related OTUs were the only taxa overrepresented in RA BAL and correlated with higher disease activity and erosions.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Distal airway dysbiosis is present in untreated early RA and similar to that detected in sarcoidosis lung inflammation. This community perturbation, which correlates with local and systemic autoimmune/inflammatory changes, may potentially drive initiation of RA in a proportion of cases.</AbstractText> "

Renal biopsy is the gold standard when it comes to knowing whether a patient has lupus nephritis, and the degree of renal disease present. However, the biopsy has various complications, bleeding being the most common. Therefore, the development of alternative, non-invasive diagnostic tests for kidney disease in patients with SLE is a priority. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are differentially expressed in various tissues, and changes in their expression have been associated with several pathological processes. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the abundance of miRNAs in plasma samples from patients with lupus nephritis that could potentially allow the diagnosis of renal damage in SLE patients. This is an observational case-control cross-sectional study, in which we characterized the differential abundance profiles of miRNAs among patients with different degrees of lupus compared with SLE patients without renal involvement and healthy control individuals. We found 89 miRNAs with changes in their abundance between lupus nephritis patients and healthy controls, and 17 miRNAs that showed significant variations between SLE patients with or without renal involvement. Validation for qPCR of a group of miRNAs on additional samples from lupus patients with or without nephritis, and from healthy individuals, showed that five miRNAs presented an average detection sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 70.3%, a positive predictive value of 82.5%, a negative predictive value of 96% and a diagnosis efficiency of 87.9%. These results strongly suggest that miR-221-5p, miR-380-3p, miR-556-5p, miR-758-3p and miR-3074-3p are potential diagnostic biomarkers of lupus nephritis in patients with SLE. The observed differential pattern of miRNA abundance may have functional implications in the pathophysiology of SLE renal damage.</AbstractText> "

Emerging high throughput sequencing technologies have been proved to be a useful platform to understand the complex and dynamic disease processes. SLE patients categorised based on autoantibody specificities are reported to have differential immuno-regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq analysis to identify transcriptomics of SLE patients with distinguished autoantibody specificities. The SLE patients were segregated into three subsets based on the type of autoantibodies present in their sera (anti-dsDNA+ group with anti-dsDNA autoantibody alone; anti-ENA+ group having autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) only, and anti-dsDNA+ENA+ group having autoantibodies to both dsDNA and ENA). Global transcriptome profiling for each SLE patients subsets was performed using Illumina® Hiseq-2000 platform. The biological relevance of dysregulated transcripts in each SLE subsets was assessed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software. We observed that dysregulation in the transcriptome expression pattern was clearly distinct in each SLE patients subsets. IPA analysis of transcripts uniquely expressed in different SLE groups revealed specific biological pathways to be affected in each SLE subsets. Multiple cytokine signaling pathways were specifically dysregulated in anti-dsDNA+ patients whereas Interferon signaling was predominantly dysregulated in anti-ENA+ patients. In anti-dsDNA+ENA+ patients regulation of actin based motility by Rho pathway was significantly affected. The granulocyte gene signature was a common feature to all SLE subsets; however, anti-dsDNA+ group showed relatively predominant expression of these genes. Dysregulation of Plasma cell related transcripts were higher in anti-dsDNA+ and anti-ENA+ patients as compared to anti-dsDNA+ ENA+. Association of specific canonical pathways with the uniquely expressed transcripts in each SLE subgroup indicates that specific immunological disease mechanisms are operative in distinct SLE patients' subsets. This 'sub-grouping' approach could further be useful for clinical evaluation of SLE patients and devising targeted therapeutics.</AbstractText> "

Here we describe an 8-year-old female proband presenting with diffuse cutaneous SSc/scleroderma and a family history of SSc in a grandfather and maternal aunt.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We employed whole exome sequencing (WES) of three members of this family. We examined rare missense, nonsense, splice-altering, and coding indels matching an autosomal dominant inheritance model. We selected one missense variant for Sanger sequencing confirmation based on its predicted impact on gene function and location in a known SSc genetic locus.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Bioinformatic analysis found eight candidate variants meeting our criteria. We identified a very rare missense variant in the regulatory NODP domain of NOTCH4 located at the 6p21 locus, c.4245G &gt; A:p.Met1415Ile, segregating with the phenotype. This allele has a frequency of 1.83 × 10<sup>-5</sup> by the data of the Exome Aggregation Consortium.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This family suggests a novel mechanism of SSc pathogenesis in which a rare and penetrant coding variation can substantially elevate disease risk in contrast to the more modest non-coding variation typically found at this locus.

Approximately two-thirds of all patients with scleroderma present with three dominant autoantibody subsets. Here, we used a pair of complementary high-throughput methods for antibody epitope discovery to examine patients with scleroderma with or without known autoantibody specificities. We identified a specificity for the minor spliceosome complex containing RNA Binding Region (RNP1, RNA recognition motif) Containing 3 (RNPC3) that is found in patients with scleroderma without known specificities and is absent in unrelated autoimmune diseases. We found strong evidence for both intra- and intermolecular epitope spreading in patients with RNA polymerase III (POLR3) and the minor spliceosome specificities. Our results demonstrate the utility of these technologies in rapidly identifying antibodies that can serve as biomarkers of disease subsets in the evolving precision medicine era.</AbstractText> "

We identified a mutation in the gene encoding the deubiquitination enzyme USP15 (Usp15<sup>L749R</sup>) that protected mice against both experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) induced by Plasmodium berghei and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Combining immunophenotyping and RNA sequencing in brain (ECM) and spinal cord (EAE) revealed that Usp15<sup>L749R</sup>-associated resistance to neuroinflammation was linked to dampened type I interferon responses in situ. In hematopoietic cells and in resident brain cells, USP15 was coexpressed with, and functionally acted together with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 to positively regulate type I interferon responses and to promote pathogenesis during neuroinflammation. The USP15-TRIM25 dyad might be a potential target for intervention in acute or chronic states of neuroinflammation.</AbstractText> "

Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) and valosin-containing protein (VCP) are 2 key genes associated with several neurodegenerative disorders but have yet to be thoroughly investigated in sIBM. A candidate gene analysis was conducted using whole-exome sequencing data from 181 sIBM patients, and whole-transcriptome expression analysis was performed in patients with genetic variants of interest. We identified 6 rare missense variants in the SQSTM1 and VCP in 7 sIBM patients (4.0%). Two variants, the SQSTM1 p.G194R and the VCP p.R159C, were significantly overrepresented in this sIBM cohort compared with controls. Five of these variants had been previously reported in patients with degenerative diseases. The messenger RNA levels of major histocompatibility complex genes were upregulated, this elevation being more pronounced in SQSTM1 patient group. We report for the first time potentially pathogenic SQSTM1 variants and expand the spectrum of VCP variants in sIBM. These data suggest that defects in neurodegenerative pathways may confer genetic susceptibility to sIBM and reinforce the mechanistic overlap in these neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

"582";"27733572";"Neutrophil biomarkers predict response to therapy with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis.";" <AbstractText>Neutrophils are implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the mechanisms regulating their activation are largely unknown. RA is a heterogeneous disease, and whereas many patients show clinical improvement during TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy, a significant proportion fails to respond. In vitro activation of neutrophils with agents, including TNF, results in rapid and selective changes in gene expression, but how neutrophils contribute to TNF signaling in RA and whether TNFi sensitivity involves differential neutrophil responses are unknown. With the use of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we analyzed blood neutrophils from 20 RA patients, pre-TNFi therapy, to identify biomarkers of response, measured by a decrease in disease activity score based on 28 joint count (DAS28), 12 wk post-therapy. Biomarkers were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of blood neutrophils from 2 further independent cohorts of RA patients: 16 pre-TNFi and 16 predisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Twenty-three neutrophil transcripts predicted a 12-wk response to TNFi: 10 (IFN-regulated) genes predicting a European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response and 13 different genes [neutrophil granule protein (NGP) genes] predicting a nonresponse. Statistical analysis indicated a predictive sensitivity and specificity of each gene in the panel of &gt;80%, with some 100% specific. A combination of 3 genes [<i>cytidine monophosphate kinase 2</i> (<i>CMPK2</i>), <i>IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1B</i> (<i>IFIT1B</i>), and <i>RNASE3</i>] had the greatest predictive power [area under the curve (AUC) 0.94]. No correlation was found for a response to DMARDs. We conclude that this panel of genes is selective for predicting a response to TNFi and is not a surrogate marker for disease improvement. We also show that in RA, there is great plasticity in neutrophil phenotype, with circulating cells expressing genes normally only expressed in more immature cells.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Society for Leukocyte Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "

Cytokines (NK cell-stimulating and others) were quantified in plasma samples (n = 18). NK cell phenotype and cytotoxic activity against tumor cells were determined (n = 10), together with their interferon-γ (IFNγ)-producing function (n = 8).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">NK cells from the systemic JIA patients showed an altered gene expression profile compared to cells from the healthy controls, with enrichment of immunoinflammatory pathways, increased expression of innate genes including TLR4 and S100A9, and decreased expression of immune-regulating genes such as IL10RA and GZMK. In the patients' plasma, interleukin-18 (IL-18) levels were increased, and a decreased ratio of IFNγ to IL-18 was observed. NK cells from the patients exhibited specific alterations in the balance of inhibitory and activating receptors, with decreased killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 and increased NKp44 expression. Although NK cells from the patients showed increased granzyme B expression, consistent with intact cytotoxicity and degranulation against a tumor cell line, decreased granzyme K expression in CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells and defective IL-18-induced IFNγ production and signaling were demonstrated.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">NK cells are active players in the inflammatory environment typical of systemic JIA.

LDGs from 32 RA patients were characterized using flow cytometry and quantitative PCR (qPCR). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was carried out on paired RA LDGs and neutrophils (n = 4) and validated using qPCR. Functional assays included chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell-cycle analysis, apoptosis, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)osis, and measurement of cytokine production (n ≥ 5 paired RA LDGs/neutrophils). RA LDGs had a substantially altered transcriptome, expressing &gt;5000 genes at significantly different levels compared with RA neutrophils, including elevated levels of transcripts for granule proteins [including elastase and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] and cell-cycle genes [including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, CDK4, and CDK6]. Approximately 1% of RA LDGs stained positive for the G2/S phase of the cell cycle. RA LDGs had a significantly lower constitutive rate of apoptosis compared with RA neutrophils and did not respond to TNF-α in culture. Expression of transcripts for cytokines and cytokine receptors was lower in RA LDGs. NET formation was lower in LDGs in response to PMA compared with RA neutrophils. Chemotaxis and phagocytosis was lower in RA LDGs compared with neutrophils. RA LDGs produced significantly lower amounts of ROS in response to fMLP following priming with TNF-α. Expression of TNFR1 and -2 mRNA and protein was significantly lower in LDGs. We conclude that RA LDGS are functionally different from RA neutrophils, representing an immature neutrophil population within peripheral blood. Their enhanced survival properties and decreased TNF signaling are likely to have important consequences for disease pathology and response to therapy.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Society for Leukocyte Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "

This study evaluated 69 significant expressed profiles of microRNA (miRNA) in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone after ESWT. There were 118 target genes identified for miRNAs of interest in articular cartilage and 214 target genes in subchondral bone by next generation sequencing (NGS). In principal component analysis (PCA), the relationships of miRNA expression in bone and cartilage were improved after ESWT. Global functional annotation showed that predicted targets were involved in cartilage development, inflammatory and immune response, ion binding, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, cell cycle, transcription and translation, gene expression, NTP binding, signal transduction, collagen fibril organization, apoptotic process, chondrocyte differentiation, cell differentiation, bone development as well as cell proliferation. The miRNAs profile and the target genes were comprehensively surveyed and compared in articular cartilage and subchondral bone of early OA knee before and after ESWT. Our study represents the direct assessment to date of miRNA expression profiling in early OA articular cartilage and subchondral bone. The results provide insights that could contribute to the development of new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for OA changes and the treatment with ESWT.</AbstractText> "

However, the impact of changes in microRNA expression on posttranslational processes involved in TNF-α signaling networks is not well defined in RA. In this study, we evaluated the effect of miR-17, a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, on the TNF-α signaling pathway in human RA synovial fibroblasts (SFs). We demonstrated that miR-17 expression was significantly low in RA serum, SFs, and synovial tissues, as well as in the serum and joints of adjuvant-induced arthritis rats. RNA-sequencing analysis showed modulation of 664 genes by pre-miR-17 in human RA SFs. Ingenuity pathway analysis of RNA-sequencing data identified the ubiquitin proteasome system in the TNF-α signaling pathway as a primary target of miR-17. Western blot analysis confirmed the reduction in TRAF2, cIAP1, cIAP2, USP2, and PSMD13 expression by miR-17 in TNF-α-stimulated RA SFs. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that miR-17 restoration increased the K48-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF2, cIAP1, and cIAP2 in TNF-α-stimulated RA SFs. Thus, destabilization of TRAF2 by miR-17 reduced the ability of TRAF2 to associate with cIAP2, resulting in the downregulation of TNF-α-induced NF-κBp65, c-Jun, and STAT3 nuclear translocation and the production of IL-6, IL-8, MMP-1, and MMP-13 in human RA SFs. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the role of miR-17 as a negative regulator of TNF-α signaling by modulating the protein ubiquitin processes in RA SFs.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

Simultaneous knockdown of HDAC5 in conjunction with either CYR61, PVRL2, or FSTL1 inhibited angiogenesis in SSc ECs. Conversely, overexpression of these genes individually led to an increase in tube formation as assessed by Matrigel assay, suggesting that these genes play functional roles in the impairment of angiogenesis in SSc.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Several novel HDAC5-regulated target genes associated with impaired angiogenesis were identified in SSc ECs by ATAC-seq.

Obesity causes several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, osteoarthritis, hypertension, stroke, type II diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and several types of cancer. Previous genome-wide association studies have identified several genes associated with obesity, including LEP, LEPR, POMC, PCSK1, FTO, MC3R, MC4R, GNPDA2, TMEM18, QPCTL/GIPR, BDNF, ETV5, MAP2K5/SKOR1, SEC16B, SIM1, and TNKS/MSRA. However, most of these variants are found in the intronic or intergenic regions, making it difficult to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we performed a whole exome sequencing of the protein-coding regions in the total genome (exome) of two obese and one normal subject belonging to the same Thai family to identify the genes responsible for obesity. We identified 709 functional variants that were differentially expressed between obese and normal subjects; of these, 65 were predicted to be deleterious to protein structure or function.

Genotyping revealed HCRTR1, COL9A2, and TRPM8 to be associated with the regulation of feeding behavior and energy expenditure. These genes constituted a network of pathways, including lipid metabolism, signaling transduction, immune, membrane transport, and gene regulation pathways, and seemed to play important roles in obesity. </AbstractText> "

Two weeks after the first dose, he experienced anorexia and fatigue, and suffered from progressive, severe dyspnea and muscle weakness. We diagnosed him with myocarditis, myositis, and myasthenic crisis induced by nivolumab. We commenced steroid therapy, immune absorption therapy, plasma exchange therapy, and i.v. immunoglobulin therapy, and succeeded in saving his life. Because his serum level of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in a sample collected before nivolumab treatment were positive and were elevated significantly after nivolumab, we suspected that nivolumab triggered a severe autoimmune response, which progressed subclinical myasthenia gravis to myasthenic crisis. We carried out T cell receptor repertoire analysis using next-generation sequencing technologies and identified infiltration of clonally expanded T cell populations in the skeletal muscle after nivolumab treatment, implying a very strong T cell immune response against muscular cells. To avoid severe immune-related adverse events, the exclusion of patients with subclinical autoimmune disease is very important for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 The Authors.

The underlying etiology remains largely unknown.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Aiming to understand the pathogenesis of SLE, a detailed study was conducted. Renal tubular cells-derived iPSCs were successfully obtained from the urine of SLE patients and healthy controls. With the purpose to identify simultaneous expression profiling of microRNA, mRNA and protein, Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 System and iTRAQ-coupled 2D LC-MS/MS analysis were utilized in systemic lupus erythematosus-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (SLE-iPSCs) and normal control-iPSCs (NC-iPSCs). The integration of multiple profiling datasets was realized since it could facilitate the identification of non-seed miRNA targets, as well as differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">For this study, profiling datasets of 1099 differentially expressed mRNAs, 223 differentially expressed microRNAs and 94 differentially expressed proteins were integrated. In order to investigate the influence of miRNA on the processes of regulating mRNAs and proteins' levels, potential targets of differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins were predicted using miRanda, TargetScan and Pictar. Multiple profiling datasets were integrated to facilitate the identification of miRNA targets, as well as differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins. Through gene ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins, biological processes that drive proliferation were identified, such as mRNA processing and translation. Western blot and Q-PCR confirmed AK4 protein and mRNA up-regulation. The findings also showed that TAGLN's protein and mRNA level were down-regulated in SLE-iPSCs, both miR-371a-5p and let-7a-5p in SLE-iPSC were down-regulated and verified using Q-PCR. The up-regulation of AK4 involved in nucleotide biosynthesis suggested a general acceleration of anabolic metabolism induced by down-regulated miR-371a-5p, which might contribute to SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Based on high throughput analysis, integrated miRNA, mRNA, and protein expression data were generated. Differentially expressed dates were also adopted in conjunction with in-silico tools to identify potential candidates for SLE-iPSCs. Representative miRNA, mRNA and proteins were verified. It was also expected that the knowledge gained from this study can be applied to assess the usefulness of pathogenesis and novel biomarker candidates of SLE, which may develop a new way for SLE diagnosis.</AbstractText> "

Our aims were to identify TRAP substrates, determine the consequences of TRAP deficiency in immune cells, and assess whether ACP5 mutations are enriched in sporadic cases of SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Interaction between TRAP and its binding partners was tested by a yeast 2-hybrid screening, confocal microscopy, and immunoprecipitation/Western blotting. TRAP knockdown was performed using small interfering RNA. Phosphorylation of osteopontin (OPN) was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Nucleotide sequence analysis of ACP5 was performed by Sanger sequencing or next-generation sequencing.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">TRAP and OPN colocalized and interacted in human macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs). TRAP dephosphorylated 3 serine residues on specific OPN peptides. TRAP knockdown resulted in increased OPN phosphorylation and increased nuclear translocation of IRF7 and P65, with resultant heightened expression of IFN-stimulated genes and IL6 and TNF following Toll-like receptor 9 stimulation. An excess of heterozygous ACP5 missense variants was observed in SLE compared to controls (P = 0.04), and transfection experiments revealed a significant reduction in TRAP activity in a number of variants.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our findings indicate that TRAP and OPN colocalize and that OPN is a substrate for TRAP in human immune cells. TRAP deficiency in PDCs leads to increased IFNα production, providing at least a partial explanation for how ACP5 mutations cause lupus in the context of spondyloenchondrodysplasia. Detection of ACP5 missense variants in a lupus cohort suggests that impaired TRAP functioning may increase susceptibility to sporadic lupus.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

To permit early diagnosis and treatment of OA, a high resolution mechanistic understanding of human chondrocytes in normal and diseased states is necessary. In this study, we assessed the biological effects of OA-related changes in the synovial microenvironment on chondrocytes embedded within anatomically intact cartilage from joints with different pathological grades by next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We determined the transcriptome of primary articular chondrocytes derived from anatomically unaffected knees and ankles, as well as from joints affected by OA. The GALAXY bioinformatics platform was used to facilitate biological interpretations. Comparisons of patient samples by k-means, hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses together reveal that primary chondrocytes exhibit OA grade-related differences in gene expression, including genes involved in cell-adhesion, ECM production and immune response. We conclude that diseased synovial microenvironments in joints with different histopathological OA grades directly alter gene expression in chondrocytes. One ramification of this finding is that anatomically intact cartilage from OA joints is not an ideal source of healthy chondrocytes, nor should these specimens be used to generate a normal baseline for the molecular characterization of diseased joints. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016.

Previous studies suggest that pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is similar in all affected joints. Here we show that distinct DNA methylation and transcriptome signatures not only discriminate RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from osteoarthritis FLS, but also distinguish RA FLS isolated from knees and hips. Using genome-wide methods, we show differences between RA knee and hip FLS in the methylation of genes encoding biological pathways, such as IL-6 signalling via JAK-STAT pathway. Furthermore, differentially expressed genes are identified between knee and hip FLS using RNA-sequencing. Double-evidenced genes that are both differentially methylated and expressed include multiple HOX genes. Joint-specific DNA signatures suggest that RA disease mechanisms might vary from joint to joint, thus potentially explaining some of the diversity of drug responses in RA patients.</AbstractText> "

Early responses to known or novel autoantigens likely drive the eventual production of pathogenic autoimmunity. Importantly, the presence of disease-specific autoantibodies can identify individuals who are at high risk of developing RA but who do not currently have arthritis. The goal of the current study was to characterize plasmablasts from individuals at risk of developing RA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We investigated antibody-secreting plasmablasts derived from a well-characterized cohort of individuals who were at risk of developing RA, based on RA-related serum autoantibody positivity, as compared to patients with early (&lt;1 year) seropositive RA as well as healthy control subjects. The plasmablast antibody repertoires of at-risk subjects were analyzed using DNA barcode-based methods with paired heavy- and light-chain gene sequencing. Cells were single-cell sorted, the cell- and plate-specific DNA barcodes were sequentially added, and next-generation sequencing was performed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Total plasmablast levels were similar in the antibody-positive (1%) and control (0.4-1.6%) groups. However, increased frequencies of IgA+ versus IgG+ plasmablasts were observed in the antibody-positive group (39% IgA+ and 37% IgG+) as compared to other groups (1-9% IgA+ and 71-87% IgG+). Paired antibody sequences from antibody-positive subjects revealed cross-isotype clonal families and similar sequence characteristics in the IgA and IgG plasmablast repertoires. Antibody-positive individuals also demonstrated elevated serum levels of IgA isotype anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 3 antibodies.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The IgA plasmablast dominance in these antibody-positive individuals suggests that a subset of RA-related autoantibodies may arise from mucosal immune responses and may be involved in early disease pathogenesis in individuals who are at risk of developing RA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"601";"27271962";"Complexity and Specificity of the Neutrophil Transcriptomes in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis.";" <AbstractText>NIH projects such as ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics have revealed surprising complexity in the transcriptomes of mammalian cells. In this study, we explored transcriptional complexity in human neutrophils, cells generally regarded as nonspecific in their functions and responses. We studied distinct human disease phenotypes and found that, at the gene, gene isoform, and miRNA level, neutrophils exhibit considerable specificity in their transcriptomes. Thus, even cells whose responses are considered non-specific show tailoring of their transcriptional repertoire toward specific physiologic or pathologic contexts. We also found that miRNAs had a global impact on neutrophil transcriptome and are associated with innate immunity in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). These findings have important implications for our understanding of the link between genes, non-coding transcripts and disease phenotypes.</AbstractText> "

However, methods that probe the status of the epigenome are lacking. Here, the framework for applying the Assay for Transposase Accessible Sequencing (ATAC-seq) to biobanked specimens is described and was used to examine the accessibility landscape of naïve B cells from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients undergoing disease flares. An SLE specific chromatin accessibility signature was identified. Changes in accessibility occurred at loci surrounding genes involved in B cell activation and contained motifs for transcription factors that regulate B cell activation and differentiation. These data provide evidence for an altered epigenetic programming in SLE B cells and identify loci and transcription factor networks that potentially impact disease. The ability to determine the chromatin accessibility landscape and identify cis-regulatory elements has broad application to studies using biorepositories and offers significant advantages to improve the molecular information obtained from biobanked samples.</AbstractText> "

The mechanisms that limit osteoclastogenesis under inflammatory conditions are largely unknown. We previously identified transcription factor RBP-J as a key negative regulator that restrains TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone resorption. In this study, we tested whether RBP-J suppresses inflammatory osteoclastogenesis by regulating the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) important for this process. Using high-throughput sequencing of miRNAs, we obtained the first, to our knowledge, genome-wide profile of miRNA expression induced by TNF-α in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages/osteoclast precursors during inflammatory osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we identified miR-182 as a novel miRNA that promotes inflammatory osteoclastogenesis driven by TNF-α and whose expression is suppressed by RBP-J. Downregulation of miR-182 dramatically suppressed the enhanced osteoclastogenesis program induced by TNF-α in RBP-J-deficient cells. Complementary loss- and gain-of-function approaches showed that miR-182 is a positive regulator of osteoclastogenic transcription factors NFATc1 and B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1. Moreover, we identified that direct miR-182 targets, Foxo3 and Maml1, play important inhibitory roles in TNF-α-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Thus, RBP-J-regulated miR-182 promotes TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis via inhibition of Foxo3 and Maml1. Suppression of miR-182 by RBP-J serves as an important mechanism that restrains TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis. Our results provide a novel miRNA-mediated mechanism by which RBP-J inhibits osteoclastogenesis and suggest that targeting of the newly described RBP-J-miR-182-Foxo3/Maml1 axis may represent an effective therapeutic approach to suppress inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

We encountered a 13-year-old Japanese female initially diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia on the basis of clinical manifestations of severe hypercholesterolemia (initial LDL cholesterol=609 mg/dl at the age of one) and systemic intertriginous xanthomas with histories of recurrent self-limiting episodes of fever and arthritis. Both her phenotypes seemed to co-segregate in a recessive manner. We performed WES on this patient, who was considered a proband. Among 206,430 variants found in this individual, we found 18,220 nonsense, missense, or splice site variants, of which 3,087 were rare (minor allele frequency ≤ 0.01 or not reported) in 1000 Genome (Asian population). Filtering by assuming a recessive pattern of inheritance with the use of an in silico annotation prediction tool, we successfully narrowed down the candidates to the compound heterozygous mutations in the ABCG5 gene (c.1256G＞A or p.Arg419His/c.1763-1G＞A [splice acceptor site]) and to the double-compound heterozygous mutations in the MEFV gene (c.329T＞C/C or p.Leu110Pro/c.442G＞C/C or p.Glu148Val). The patient was genetically diagnosed with sitosterolemia and familial Mediterranean fever using WES for the first time. Such a comprehensive approach is useful for identifying causative mutations for multiple unrelated inheritable diseases. </AbstractText> "

Most RA GWAS loci reside outside of protein-coding regions and likely affect distal transcriptional enhancers. Furthermore, GWAS do not identify the cell types where the associated causal gene functions. Thus, mapping the transcriptional regulatory roles of GWAS hits and the relevant cell types will lead to better understanding of RA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We combine the whole-genome sequences and blood transcription profiles of 377 RA patients and identify over 6000 unique genes with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We demonstrate the quality of the identified eQTLs through comparison to non-RA individuals. We integrate the eQTLs with immune cell epigenome maps, RA GWAS risk loci, and adjustment for linkage disequilibrium to propose target genes of immune cell enhancers that overlap RA risk loci. We examine 20 immune cell epigenomes and perform a focused analysis on primary monocytes, B cells, and T cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We highlight cell-specific gene associations with relevance to RA pathogenesis including the identification of FCGR2B in B cells as possessing both intragenic and enhancer regulatory GWAS hits. We show that our RA patient cohort derived eQTL network is more informative for studying RA than that from a healthy cohort. While not experimentally validated here, the reported eQTLs and cell type-specific RA risk associations can prioritize future experiments with the goal of elucidating the regulatory mechanisms behind genetic risk associations.</AbstractText> "

T cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of lupus; however, early T cell events triggering disease flares are incompletely understood. This study was undertaken to examine DNA methylation in naive CD4+ T cells from lupus patients to determine if epigenetic remodeling in CD4+ T cells is an early event in lupus flares.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A total of 74 lupus patients with an SLE Disease Activity Index score of 0-18 were included. Naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood samples, and DNA was extracted for genome-wide methylation assessment. RNA was also extracted from a subset of patients to determine the relationship between epigenetic changes and transcription activity using RNA sequencing and microRNA arrays.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We demonstrated that naive CD4+ T cells in lupus undergo an epigenetic proinflammatory shift, implicating effector T cell responses in lupus flare. This epigenetic landscape change occurs without changes in expression of the corresponding genes, poises naive CD4+ T cells for Th2, Th17, and follicular helper T cell immune responses, and opposes inhibitory transforming growth factor β signaling. Bioinformatics analyses indicate that the epigenetic modulator EZH2 might play an important role in shifting the epigenetic landscape, with increased disease activity in lupus naive CD4+ T cells. Further, the expression of microRNA-26a, which is sensitive to glucose availability and targets EZH2, was negatively correlated with disease activity in lupus patients.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">An epigenetic landscape shift in naive CD4+ T cells that favors T cell activation and non-Th1 immune responses predates transcription activity and correlates with lupus activity.

About ∼50% of patients rupturing their anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) will develop PTOA within 1-2 decades of the injury, yet the mechanisms responsible for the development of PTOA after joint injury are not well understood. In this study, we examined whole joint gene expression by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) at 1 day, 1-, 6-, and 12 weeks post injury, in a non-invasive tibial compression (TC) overload mouse model of PTOA that mimics ACL rupture in humans. We identified 1446 genes differentially regulated between injured and contralateral joints. This includes known regulators of osteoarthritis such as MMP3, FN1, and COMP, and several new genes including Suco, Sorcs2, and Medag. We also identified 18 long noncoding RNAs that are differentially expressed in the injured joints. By comparing our data to gene expression data generated using the surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) PTOA model, we identified several common genes and shared mechanisms. Our study highlights several differences between these two models and suggests that the TC model may be a more rapidly progressing model of PTOA. This study provides the first account of gene expression changes associated with PTOA development and progression in a TC model. © 2016 The Authors.

In 2 siblings from a consanguineous family presenting with early onset polyautoimmunity, we presumed autosomal recessive inheritance and performed whole exome sequencing. We herein report the first case of early-onset, severe, chronic polyarthritis associated with LRBA deficiency. A novel 1bp insertion in the LRBA gene, abolishing protein expression, was identified in this family. Among the 2 brothers homozygous for LRBA mutation, one developed Evans syndrome and deceased at age 8.5 from complications of severe autoimmune thrombocytopenia. His brother, who carried the same homozygous LRBA mutation, early-onset erosive polyarthritis associated with chronic, bilateral, anterior uveitis and early onset type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Murine AQP9 protein expression has been verified in liver, skin, epididymis, epidermis and neuronal cells using knockout mice. Further expression sites have been reported in humans. We aimed to verify AQP9 expression in a large set of human normal organs, different cancer types, rheumatoid arthritis synovial biopsies as well as in cell lines and primary cells. Combining standardized immunohistochemistry with high-throughput mRNA sequencing, we found that AQP9 expression in normal tissues was limited, with high membranous expression only in hepatocytes. In cancer tissues, AQP9 expression was mainly found in hepatocellular carcinomas, suggesting no general contribution of AQP9 to carcinogenesis. AQP9 expression in a subset of rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue samples was affected by Humira, thereby supporting a suggested role of TNFα in AQP9 regulation in this disease. Among cell lines and primary cells, LP-1 myeloma cells expressed high levels of AQP9, whereas low expression was observed in a few other lymphoid cell lines. AQP9 mRNA and protein expression was absent in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Overall, AQP9 expression in human tissues appears to be more selective than in mice.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 The Histochemical Society.</CopyrightInformation> "

Early activation of innate immunity and expansion of a mucosal Th17 signature are soon followed by dysbiosis in HLA-B27/β2 m-Tg animals. The pathologic processes of perturbed mucosal immunity and dysbiosis strongly merit further study in both prediseased and diseased populations of patients with SpA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

The pattern of loss is consistent with damage occurring only where the mechanical loading is high. We have investigated using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and systems analyses the changes that occur in damaged OA cartilage by comparing it with intact cartilage from the same joint.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Cartilage was obtained from eight OA patients undergoing total knee replacement. RNA was extracted from cartilage on the damaged distal medial condyle (DMC) and the intact posterior lateral condyle (PLC). RNA-seq was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and systems analyses applied to identify dysregulated pathways.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In the damaged OA cartilage, there was decreased expression of chondrogenic genes SOX9, SOX6, COL11A2, COL9A1/2/3, ACAN and HAPLN1; increases in non-chondrogenic genes COL1A1, COMP and FN1; an altered pattern of secreted proteinase expression; but no expression of major inflammatory cytokines. Systems analyses by PhenomeExpress revealed significant sub-networks of DEGs including mitotic cell cycle, Wnt signalling, apoptosis and matrix organisation that were influenced by a core of altered transcription factors (TFs), FOSL1, AHR, E2F1 and FOXM1.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Gene expression changes in damaged cartilage suggested a signature non-chondrogenic response of altered matrix protein and secreted proteinase expression. There was evidence of a damage response in this late OA cartilage, which surprisingly showed features detected experimentally in the early response of cartilage to mechanical overload.

H3K4me3 is a canonical chromatin mark of active transcription. Recent studies have suggested that H3K4me3 breadth has an important regulatory role in cell identity. This project examined H3K4me3 breadth at transcription start sites (TSS) in primary monocytes and its association with differential gene transcription in SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Integrative analysis was applied to chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated from primary monocytes as well as genomic data available in public repositories. Four distinctive H3K4me3 patterns of ChIP-seq peaks were identified at 8399 TSSs. Narrow peaks were highly enriched with genes related to housekeeping functions. The broader peaks with extended H3K4me3 immediately upstream and/or downstream of TSS were associated with immune response genes. Many TSSs had downstream H3K4me3 extended to ~650 bp, where the transition of H3K4me3 to H3K36me3, a transcriptional elongation mark, is often found. The H3K4me3 pattern was strongly associated with transcription in SLE. Genes with narrow peaks were less likely (OR = 0.14, p = 2 × 10(-4)) while genes with extended downstream H3K4me3 were more likely (OR = 2.37, p = 1 × 10(-11)) to be overexpressed in SLE. Of the genes significantly overexpressed in SLE, 78.8 % had increased downstream H3K4me3 while only 47.1 % had increased upstream H3K4me3. Gene transcription sensitively and consistently responded to H3K4me3 change downstream of TSSs. Every 1 % increase of H3K4me3 in this region leads to ~1.5 % average increase of transcription.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We identified the immediate TSS downstream nucleosome as a crucial regulator responsible for transcription changes in SLE. This study applied a unique method to study the effect of H3K4me3 breadth on diseases and revealed new insights about epigenetic modifications in SLE, which could lead to novel treatments.</AbstractText> "

However, systematic investigation of their presence and significance in autoimmune diseases is lacking. This study was undertaken to examine the distinct functions of anticytokine autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) compared to patients with other rheumatic diseases and healthy controls.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Serum samples from patients with SLE (n = 199), patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome (SS) (n = 150), patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 149), and healthy controls (n = 200) were screened for 24 anticytokine autoantibodies using a multiplex bead-based assay. To evaluate the biologic activity of anticytokine autoantibodies, their ability to block cytokine-induced signal transduction or protein expression was measured. RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood in a subset of healthy controls and patients with SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Patients with SLE and those with SS had a striking excess of autoantibodies against interferons and the interferon-responsive chemokine interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10). Only autoantibodies against type I interferon, interleukin-12 (IL-12), and IL-22 exhibited neutralizing activity. In SLE, the presence of anti-interferon-γ autoantibodies was correlated with more severe disease activity, higher levels of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and elevated expression of interferon-α/β-inducible genes. Conversely, in SLE patients with blocking anti-interferon-α autoantibodies, the type I interferon gene expression signature was normalized. Anti-type III interferon autoantibodies (λ2, λ3) and anti-IP-10 autoantibodies were newly recognized in SLE patient serum, and autoantibodies against macrophage-colony stimulating factor, IL-4, IL-7, IL-17, and IL-22, none of which have been previously identified in rheumatic conditions, were discovered.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Anticytokine autoantibodies are associated with distinct patterns of disease in SLE, SS, and RA. Anti-interferon autoantibodies are overrepresented in patients with SLE and those with SS, and fall into distinct functional classes, with only a subset of anti-type I interferon antibodies exhibiting neutralizing activity. Anti-interferon-γ autoantibodies are correlated with increased disease activity and interferon-related gene expression, suggesting that such autoantibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of SLE.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

The T cell receptor β chain (TRB) was amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing was performed, with amplicons sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq platform. Data were analyzed using ImmunoSEQ, International ImMunoGeneTics system, and the Immunoglobulin Analysis Tools.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Compared to findings in controls, the JIA peripheral blood Treg cell repertoire was restricted, and clonotypic expansions were found in both blood and synovial fluid Treg cells. Skewed usage and pairing of TRB variable and joining genes, including overuse of gene segments that have been associated with other autoimmune conditions, was observed. JIA patients shared a substantial portion of synovial fluid Treg cell clonotypes that were private to JIA and not identified in Lyme arthritis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">We identified restriction and clonotypic expansions in the JIA Treg cell repertoire with sharing of Treg cell clonotypes across patients. These findings suggest that abnormalities in the Treg cell repertoire, possibly engendered by shared antigenic triggers, may contribute to disease pathogenesis in JIA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

We performed DNA microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) mRNA from 41 Japanese BD patients and revealed elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 23 receptor (IL23R) mRNA in many BD patients. DNA sequencing around a SNV (Rs12119179) tightly linked to BD revealed an elevated frequency of the C genotype, consistent with a previous report that IL23R is a susceptibility locus for BD. Notably, four of these BD patients are members of familial BD; a whole-exome sequencing (WES) of these BD patients identified 19 novel single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) specific to these patients. They include heterozygous SNVs in the genes encoding IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 14 (NRP14) and melanoma antigen-encoding gene E2 (MAGEE2); IRAK4 harbors a missense mutation, whereas NRP14 and MAGEE2 harbor nonsense mutations. These SNVs may serve as genetic markers that characterize BD. </AbstractText> "

CD154 up-regulation was measured as a marker of antigen-specific activation, and anti-HLA-DR-blocking experiments confirmed HLA restriction. Cytokine production was measured using a Luminex technique. Direct peptide-binding assays using HLA-DRB1*10:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:01 monomeric proteins were performed. The T cell receptor (TCR) β-chain of CD154-enriched antigen-specific T cells was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A novel Cit-CII peptide was identified based on its ability to activate CD4+ T cells from HLA-DRB1*10:01-positive individuals. When stimulated in vitro, Cit-CII autoreactive T cells produced proinflammatory cytokines. Cit-CII(311-325) bound (with low affinity) to HLA-DRB1*10:01 but not to HLA-DRB1*04:01, while the native form was unable to bind either protein.

Although periodontitis has been studied extensively, neither disease-specific biomarkers nor therapeutic targets have been identified, nor its link with systemic diseases. Here, we analyzed the global transcriptome of periodontitis and compared its gene expression profile with those of other inflammatory conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and ulcerative colitis (UC). Gingival biopsies from 62 patients with periodontitis and 62 healthy subjects were subjected to RNA sequencing. The up-regulated genes in periodontitis were related to inflammation, wounding and defense response, and apoptosis, whereas down-regulated genes were related to extracellular matrix organization and structural support. The most highly up-regulated gene was mucin 4 (MUC4), and its protein product was confirmed to be over-expressed in periodontitis. When comparing the expression profile of periodontitis with other inflammatory diseases, several gene ontology categories, including inflammatory response, cell death, cell motion, and homeostatic processes, were identified as common to all diseases. Only one gene, pleckstrin (PLEK), was significantly overexpressed in periodontitis, CVD, RA, and UC, implicating this gene as an important networking link between these chronic inflammatory diseases. </AbstractText> "

Genetic association studies have shown that a number of common variants increase the risk of developing OA. Investigating their activity can uncover novel causal pathways and potentially highlight new treatment targets. One of the reported OA association signals is marked by the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11842874 at chromosome 13q34. rs11842874 is positioned within a small linkage disequilibrium (LD) block within intron 4 of MCF2L, a gene encoding guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DBS. There are no non-synonymous SNPs that correlate with this association signal and we therefore set out to assess whether its effect on OA susceptibility is mediated by alteration of MCF2L expression.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Nucleic acid was extracted from cartilage, synovial membrane or infrapatellar fat pad tissues from OA patients.

SLE activity is experimentally assessed by several blood tests, including gene expression profiling of heterogeneous populations of cells in peripheral blood. To better understand the contribution of different cell types in SLE pathogenesis, we applied the two methods in cell-type-specific differential expression analysis, csSAM and DSection, to identify cell-type-specific gene expression differences in heterogeneous gene expression measures obtained using RNA-seq technology. We identified B-cell-, monocyte-, and neutrophil-specific gene expression differences. Immunoglobulin-coding gene expression was altered in B-cells, while a ribosomal signature was prominent in monocytes. On the contrary, genes differentially expressed in the heterogeneous mixture of cells did not show any functional enrichment. Our results identify antigen binding and structural constituents of ribosomes as functions altered by B-cell- and monocyte-specific gene expression differences, respectively. Finally, these results position both csSAM and DSection methods as viable techniques for cell-type-specific differential expression analysis, which may help uncover pathogenic, cell-type-specific processes in SLE. </AbstractText> "

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is an exceptionally well-suited model for studying autoimmune diseases due to its early onset and the possibility to analyze cells derived from the site of inflammation. Epigenetic profiling, utilizing primary JIA patient-derived cells, can contribute to the understanding of autoimmune diseases. With H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation, we identified a disease-specific, inflammation-associated, typical enhancer and super-enhancer signature in JIA patient synovial-fluid-derived CD4(+) memory/effector T cells. RNA sequencing of autoinflammatory site-derived patient T cells revealed that BET inhibition, utilizing JQ1, inhibited immune-related super-enhancers and preferentially reduced disease-associated gene expression, including cytokine-related processes. Altogether, these results demonstrate the potential use of enhancer profiling to identify disease mediators and provide evidence for BET inhibition as a possible therapeutic approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

"636";"26359667";"Bioinformatics-Based Identification of MicroRNA-Regulated and Rheumatoid Arthritis-Associated Genes.";" <AbstractText>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as epigenetic markers and regulate the expression of their target genes, including those characterized as regulators in autoimmune diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. The potential roles of miRNA-regulated genes in RA pathogenesis have greatly aroused the interest of clinicians and researchers in recent years. In the current study, RA-related miRNAs records were obtained from PubMed through conditional literature retrieval. After analyzing the selected records, miRNA targeted genes were predicted. We identified 14 RA-associated miRNAs, and their sub-analysis in 5 microarray or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets was performed. The microarray and RNA-seq data of RA were also downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA), analyzed, and annotated. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified a series of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing studies on RA and the controls. The RA-related gene expression profile was thus obtained and the expression of miRNA-regulated genes was analyzed. After functional annotation analysis, we found GO molecular function (MF) terms significantly enriched in calcium ion binding (GO: 0005509). Moreover, some novel dysregulated target genes were identified in RA through integrated analysis of miRNA/mRNA expression. The result revealed that the expression of a number of genes, including ROR2, ABI3BP, SMOC2, etc., was not only affected by dysregulated miRNAs, but also altered in RA. Our findings indicate that there is a close association between negatively correlated mRNA/miRNA pairs and RA. These findings may be applied to identify genetic markers for RA diagnosis and treatment in the future. </AbstractText> "

The treatment for both RA and T2D are not satisfied, partly because of the linkage between them has not yet been appreciated. A comprehensive study for the potential associations between the two disorders is needed. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to explore the differently expressed genes (DEGs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 10 RA and 10 T2D patients comparing with 10 healthy volunteers (control). We used bioinformatics analysis and the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to predict the commonalities on signaling pathways and molecular networks between those two diseases. 212 DEGs in RA and 114 DEGs in T2D patients were identified compared with healthy controls, respectively. 32 DEGs were shared between the two comparisons. The top 10 shared pathways interacted in cross-talking networks, regulated by 5 shared predicted upstream regulators, leading to the activated immune response were explored, which was considered as partly of the association mechanism of this two disorders. These discoveries would be considered as new understanding on the associations between RA and T2D, and provide novel treatment or prevention strategy. </AbstractText> "

"641";"26245356";"Quantitative and qualitative characterization of expanded CD4+ T cell clones in rheumatoid arthritis patients.";" <AbstractText>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune destructive arthritis associated with CD4(+) T cell-mediated immunity. Although expanded CD4(+) T cell clones (ECs) has already been confirmed, the detailed characteristics of ECs have not been elucidated in RA. Using combination of a single-cell analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) in TCR repertoire analysis, we here revealed the detailed nature of ECs by examining peripheral blood (PB) from 5 RA patients and synovium from 1 RA patient. When we intensively investigated the single-cell transcriptome of the most expanded clones in memory CD4(+) T cells (memory-mECs) in RA-PB, senescence-related transcripts were up-regulated, indicating circulating ECs were constantly stimulated. Tracking of the transcriptome shift within the same memory-mECs between PB and the synovium revealed the augmentations in senescence-related gene expression and the up-regulation of synovium-homing chemokine receptors in the synovium. Our in-depth characterization of ECs in RA successfully demonstrated the presence of the specific immunological selection pressure, which determines the phenotype of ECs. Moreover, transcriptome tracking added novel aspects to the underlying sequential immune processes. Our approach may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of RA. </AbstractText> "

"643";"26198357";"A dual role for NOTCH signaling in joint cartilage maintenance and osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Loss of NOTCH signaling in postnatal murine joints results in osteoarthritis, indicating a requirement for NOTCH during maintenance of joint cartilage. However, NOTCH signaling components are substantially increased in abundance in posttraumatic osteoarthritis in humans and mice, suggesting either a reparative or a pathological role for NOTCH activation in osteoarthritis. We investigated a potential dual role for NOTCH in joint maintenance and osteoarthritis by generating two mouse models overexpressing the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD) within postnatal joint cartilage. The first mouse model exhibited sustained NOTCH activation to resemble pathological NOTCH signaling, whereas the second model had transient NOTCH activation, which more closely reflected physiological NOTCH signaling. Sustained NOTCH signaling in joint cartilage led to an early and progressive osteoarthritic-like pathology, whereas transient NOTCH activation enhanced the synthesis of cartilage matrix and promoted joint maintenance under normal physiological conditions. Through RNA-sequencing, immunohistochemical, and biochemical approaches, we identified several targets that could be responsible for NOTCH-mediated cartilage degradation, fibrosis, and osteoarthritis progression. These targets included components of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, which may also contribute to the posttraumatic development of osteoarthritis. Together, these data suggest a dual role for the NOTCH pathway in joint cartilage, and they identify downstream effectors of NOTCH signaling as potential targets for disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science.</CopyrightInformation> "

Clonal expansion of T cells correlating with disease activity has been observed in peripheral blood (PB) of SLE subjects. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the T cell receptor (TCR) β loci has emerged as a sensitive way to measure the T cell repertoire. In this study, we utilized NGS to assess whether changes in T cell repertoire diversity in PB of SLE patients correlate with or predict changes in disease activity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Total RNA was isolated from the PB of 11 SLE patients. Each subject had three samples, collected at periods of clinical quiescence and at a flare. Twelve age-matched healthy controls (HC) were used for reference. NGS was used to profile the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the rearranged TCR β loci.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Relative to the HC, SLE patients (at quiescence) demonstrated a 2.2-fold reduction in repertoire diversity in a given PB volume (P &lt;0.0002), a more uneven distribution of the repertoire (Gini coefficient, HC vs SLE, P = 0.015), and a trend toward increased percentage of expanded clones in the repertoire (clone size &gt;1.0%, HC vs SLE, P = 0.078). No significant correlation between the overall repertoire diversity and clinical disease activity was observed for most SLE patients with only two of eleven SLE patients showing a decreasing trend in repertoire diversity approaching the flare time point. We did not observe any overlap of CDR3 amino acid sequences or a preferential Vβ or Jβ gene usage among the top 100 expanded clones from all SLE patients. In both HC and SLE, the majority of the expanded clones were remarkably stable over time (HC = 5.5 ±0.5 months, SLE = 7.2 ±2.4 months).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">A significant decrease in T cell repertoire diversity was observed in PB of SLE patients compared to HC. However, in most SLE patients, repertoire diversity did not change significantly with increases in disease activity to a flare. Thus, without a priori knowledge of disease-specific clones, monitoring TCR repertoire in PB from SLE patients is not likely to be useful to predict changes in disease activity.</AbstractText> "

SD loci often show copy numbers variations (CNV), which are difficult to tag with genotyping methods. CNV in the Fcγ receptor region (FCGR) has been suggested to be associated with rheumatic diseases. The objective of this study was to delineate association of FCGR-CNV with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), coeliac disease and Inflammatory bowel disease incidence. We developed a method to accurately quantify CNV in SD loci based on the intensity values from the Immunochip platform and applied it to the FCGR locus. We determined the method's validity using three independent assays: segregation analysis in families, arrayCGH, and whole genome sequencing. Our data showed the presence of two separate CNVs in the FCGR locus. The first region encodes FCGR2A, FCGR3A and part of FCGR2C gene, the second encodes another part of FCGR2C, FCGR3B and FCGR2B. Analysis of CNV status in 4578 individuals with RA and 5457 controls indicated association of duplications in the FCGR3B gene in antibody-negative RA (P=0.002, OR=1.43). Deletion in FCGR3B was associated with increased risk of antibody-positive RA, consistently with previous reports (P=0.023, OR=1.23). A clear genotype-phenotype relationship was observed: CNV polymorphisms of the FCGR3A gene correlated to CD16A expression (encoded by FCGR3A) on CD8 T-cells. In conclusion, our method allows determining the CNV status of the FCGR locus, we identified association of CNV in FCGR3B to RA and showed a functional relationship between CNV in the FCGR3A gene and CD16A expression. </AbstractText> "

To investigate the molecular mechanism of allopurinol-induced SCAR, we enrolled 21 patients (13 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 8 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)), 11 tolerant controls, and 23 healthy donors. We performed in vitro T-cell activation assays by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with allopurinol, oxypurinol, or febuxostat and measuring the expression of granulysin and IFN-γ in the supernatants of cultures. TCR repertoire was investigated by next-generation sequencing. Oxypurinol stimulation resulted in a significant increase in granulysin in the cultures of blood samples from SCAR patients (n=14) but not tolerant controls (n=11) or healthy donors (n=23). Oxypurinol induced T-cell response in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, whereas allopurinol or febuxostat did not. T cells from patients with allopurinol-SCAR showed no crossreactivity with febuxostat. Preferential TCR-V-β usage and clonal expansion of specific CDR3 (third complementarity-determining region) were found in the blister cells from skin lesions (n=8) and oxypurinol-activated T-cell cultures (n=4) from patients with allopurinol-SCAR.

"652";"25700344";"Immunoglobulin kappa variable region gene selection during early human B cell development in health and systemic lupus erythematosus.";" <AbstractText>The unique specificity of the B cell receptor is generated by an ordered sequence of gene rearrangement events. Once IGH genes have rearranged, rearrangement at the IGK locus is initiated followed by the IGL locus if functional IGK rearrangement is not achieved. Receptor specificity can subsequently be altered by secondary light chain editing based on the features of the heavy and light chain combination. The final profile of expressed genes is not random and biases in this profile are associated with several autoimmune diseases. However, how and when biases are created is not known. To increase our understanding of the processes of selection and editing of IGK rearrangements, we compared four groups of rearrangements of IGK acquired by next generation sequencing. First, expressed rearrangements of IGK from cDNA of IGK expressing B cells. Second, productive rearrangements of IGK from DNA of the same kappa expressing B cells. Third, non-productive rearrangements of IGK from DNA of IGK and IGL expressing B cells, and fourth productively rearranged IGK from DNA of IGL expressing B cells. The latter group would have been rejected during B cell development in favour of rearrangement at the IGL locus and are therefore selected against. We saw evidence that rearranged IGK segments can be selected at a checkpoint where the decision to rearrange the IGL locus is made. In addition, our data suggest that mechanisms regulating the expression or not of IGK rearrangements may also contribute to repertoire development and also that this latter component of the selection process is defective in SLE. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied the number of COX-deficient fibers and the amount of mtDNA deletions, and if variants in nuclear genes involved in mtDNA maintenance may contribute to the occurrence of mtDNA deletions in IBM muscle. Twenty-six IBM patients were included. COX-deficient fibers were assayed by morphometry and mtDNA deletions by qPCR. POLG was analyzed in all patients by Sanger sequencing and C10orf2 (Twinkle), DNA2, MGME1, OPA1, POLG2, RRM2B, SLC25A4 and TYMP in six patients by next generation sequencing. Patients with many COX-deficient muscle fibers had a significantly higher proportion of mtDNA deletions than patients with few COX-deficient fibers. We found previously unreported variants in POLG and C10orf2 and IBM patients had a significantly higher frequency of an RRM2B variant than controls. POLG variants appeared more common in IBM patients with many COX-deficient fibers, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that COX-deficient fibers in inclusion body myositis are associated with multiple mtDNA deletions. In IBM patients we found novel and also previously reported variants in genes of importance for mtDNA maintenance that warrants further studies. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) interactions that influence H4 acetylation (H4ac) in SLE. Intracellular flow cytometry for H4 acetylated lysine (K) 5, K8, K12, and K16 was performed. Histone acetylation was defined in monocytes and T cells from controls and SLE patients. RNA-Seq studies were performed on monocytes to look for an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzyme expression. Expression levels were validated using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. IRF1 induction of H4ac was evaluated using D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. IRF1 protein interactions were studied using co-immunoprecipitation assays. IRF1-dependent recruitment of histone acetyltransferases to target genes was examined by ChIP assays using p300 antibody. Flow cytometry data showed significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, and H4K16 acetylation in SLE monocytes. HDAC3 and HDAC11 gene expression were decreased in SLE monocytes. PCAF showed significantly higher gene expression in SLE than controls. IRF1-overexpressing D54MG cells were associated with significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12 acetylation compared to vector-control D54MG cells both globally and at specific target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using D54MG cells revealed IRF1 protein-protein interactions with PCAF, P300, CBP, GCN5, ATF2, and HDAC3. ChIP experiments demonstrated increased p300 recruitment to known IRF1 targets in D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. In contrast, p300 binding to IRF1 targets decreased in D54MG cells with IRF1 knockdown. SLE appears to be associated with an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzymes favoring pathologic H4 acetylation. Furthermore, IRF1 directly interacts with chromatin modifying enzymes, supporting a model where recruitment to specific target genes is mediated in part by IRF1.</AbstractText> "

However, the relationship between the composition and variation in the TCR β-chain CDR3 repertoire and SLE has not been established. Here, we compared and analyzed the thymic and splenic TCR β-chain CDR3 mRNA sequences by Roche 454 high-throughput sequencing from MRL/lpr mice at different ages. Our results indicate that diversity in the TCR CDR3 repertoire from the thymus and spleen from MRL/lpr mouse was significantly decreased with increased age (disease progression) and showed a bias in usage of common TRBV and TRBJ families. The N1 region insertions in the highly expressed CDR3s significantly increased with disease progression. This study provides a new perspective for studying SLE with progression of disease in clonal level of TCR, which may provide a basis for studying the mechanism of the MRL/lpr autoreactive T cells response and tailor an individualized treatment targeting these T cells. </AbstractText> "

The tight skin (Tsk)2/+ mouse model of SSc demonstrates signs similar to SSc including tight skin and excessive deposition of dermal ECM proteins. By linkage analysis, we mapped the Tsk2 gene mutation to &lt;3 megabases on chromosome 1. We performed both RNA sequencing of skin transcripts and genome capture DNA sequencing of the region spanning this interval in Tsk2/+ and wild-type littermates. A missense point mutation in the procollagen III amino terminal propeptide segment (PIIINP) of collagen, type III, alpha 1 (Col3a1) was found to be the best candidate for Tsk2; hence, both in vivo and in vitro genetic complementation tests were used to prove that this Col3a1 mutation is the Tsk2 gene. All previously documented mutations in the human Col3a1 gene are associated with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that leads to a defect in type III collagen synthesis. To our knowledge, the Tsk2 point mutation is the first documented gain-of-function mutation associated with Col3a1, which leads instead to fibrosis. This discovery provides insight into the mechanism of skin fibrosis manifested by Tsk2/+ mice.</AbstractText> "

Previous linkage and association studies in European-American populations suggested genetic role of IRF2 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, this observation has not yet been confirmed. No studies have been reported in the Asian populations. Here we investigated whether IRF2 polymorphisms contribute to susceptibility to SLE in a Japanese population. Association study of 46 IRF2 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected association of an intronic SNP, rs13146124, with SLE. When the association was analyzed in 834 Japanese patients with SLE and 817 healthy controls, rs13146124 T was significantly increased in SLE compared with healthy controls (dominant model, P = 5.4×10(-4), Bonferroni-corrected P [Pc] = 0.026, odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.85). To find causal SNPs, resequencing was performed by next-generation sequencing. Twelve polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with rs13146124 (r2: 0.30-1.00) were identified, among which significant association was observed for rs66801661 (allele model, P = 7.7×10(-4), Pc = 0.037, OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.19-1.96) and rs62339994 (dominant model, P = 9.0×10(-4), Pc = 0.043, OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.17-1.82). The haplotype carrying both of the risk alleles (rs66801661A-rs62339994A) was significantly increased in SLE (P = 9.9×10(-4)), while the haplotype constituted by both of the non-risk alleles (rs66801661G-rs62339994G) was decreased (P = 0.0020). A reporter assay was carried out to examine the effect of the IRF2 haplotypes on the transcriptional activity, and association of the IRF2 risk haplotype with higher transcriptional activity was detected in Jurkat T cells under IFNγ stimulation (Tukey's test, P = 1.2×10(-4)). In conclusion, our observations supported the association of IRF2 with susceptibility to SLE, and the risk haplotype was suggested to be associated with transcriptional activation of IRF2.</AbstractText> "

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) isa chronic and heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Both twin and sibling studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to lupus, but in the majority of cases the pathogenic variant remains to be identified. The genetic contribution to disease is likely to be greatest in cases with early onset and severe phenotypes. Whole-exome sequencing now offers the possibility of identifying rare alleles responsible for disease in such cases. This study was undertaken to identify genetic causes of SLE using whole-exome sequencing.Methods. We performed whole-exome sequencing in a 4-year-old girl with early-onset SLE and conducted biochemical analysis of the putative defect.Results. Whole-exome sequencing in a 4-year-old girl with cerebral lupus identified a rare, homozygous mutation in the three prime repair exonuclease 1 gene(TREX1) that was predicted to be highly deleterious.The TREX1 R97H mutant protein had a 20-fold reduction in exonuclease activity and was associated with an elevated interferon-alpha signature in the patient.The discovery and characterization of a pathogenic TREX1 variant in our proband has therapeutic implications.The patient is now a candidate for therapy. Conclusion. Our study is the first to demonstrate that whole-exome sequencing can be used to identify rare or novel deleterious variants as genetic causes of SLE and, through a personalized approach, improve therapeutic options.</AbstractText> "

"662";"25091625";"DNA methylation and mRNA and microRNA expression of SLE CD4+ T cells correlate with disease phenotype.";" <AbstractText>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease well known for its clinical heterogeneity, and its etiology secondary to a cross-talk involving genetic predisposition and environmental stimuli. Although genome-wide analysis has contributed greatly to our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE, there is increasing evidence for a role of epigenetics. Indeed, recent data have demonstrated that in patients with SLE, there are striking alterations of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and deregulated microRNA expression, the sum of which contribute to over-expression of select autoimmune-related genes and loss of tolerance. To address this issue at the level of clinical phenotype, we performed DNA methylation, mRNA and microRNA expression screening using high-throughput sequencing of purified CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE, compared to age and sex matched controls. In particular, we studied 42 patients with SLE and divided this group into three clinical phenotypes: a) the presence of skin lesions without signs of systemic pathology; b) skin lesions but also chronic renal pathology; and c) skin lesions, chronic renal pathology and polyarticular disease. Interestingly, and as expected, sequencing data revealed changes in DNA methylation in SLE compared to controls. However, and more importantly, although there were common methylation changes found in all groups of SLE compared to controls, there was specific DNA methylation changes that correlated with clinical phenotype. These included changes in the novel key target genes NLRP2, CD300LB and S1PR3, as well as changes in the critical pathways, including the adherens junction and leukocyte transendothelial migration. We also noted that a significant proportion of genes undergoing DNA methylation changes were inversely correlated with gene expression and that miRNA screening revealed the existence of subsets with changes in expression. Integrated analysis of this data highlights specific sets of miRNAs controlled by DNA methylation, and genes that are altered by methylation and targeted by miRNAs. In conclusion, our findings suggest select epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to clinical phenotypes and further shed light on a new venue for basic SLE research. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed RNA sequencing and pathway analyses in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from transgenic TNF-expressing mice, a model of RA, to identify pathways responsible for decreased osteoblast differentiation. 53 pathways were dysregulated in MSCs from RA mice, among which expression of genes encoding NOTCH pathway members and members of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway were markedly elevated. Administration of NOTCH inhibitors to RA mice prevented bone loss and osteoblast inhibition, and CFU-fibroblasts from RA mice treated with NOTCH inhibitors formed more new bone in recipient mice with tibial defects. Overexpression of the noncanonical NF-κB subunit p52 and RELB in a murine pluripotent stem cell line increased NOTCH intracellular domain-dependent (NICD-dependent) activation of an RBPjκ reporter and levels of the transcription factor HES1. TNF promoted p52/RELB binding to NICD, which enhanced binding at the RBPjκ site within the Hes1 promoter. Furthermore, MSC-enriched cells from RA patients exhibited elevated levels of HES1, p52, and RELB. Together, these data indicate that persistent NOTCH activation in MSCs contributes to decreased osteoblast differentiation associated with RA and suggest that NOTCH inhibitors could prevent inflammation-mediated bone loss. </AbstractText> "

Signalling lymphocyte activation molecule CD84 was up-regulated 16-fold (P &lt; 0·01) in acute KD CA (within 2 months of onset) and 32-fold (P &lt; 0·01) in chronic CA (5 months to years after onset). CD84 was localized to inflammatory cells in KD tissues. Genes associated with cellular proliferation, motility and survival were also up-regulated in KD CA, and immune activation molecules MX2 and SP140 were up-regulated in chronic KD. CD84, which facilitates immune responses and stabilizes platelet aggregates, is markedly up-regulated in KD CA in patients with acute and chronic arterial disease. We provide the first molecular evidence of dysregulated inflammatory responses persisting for months to years in CA significantly damaged by KD. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2014 British Society for Immunology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"671";"24608988";"High Rhodotorula sequences in skin transcriptome of patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis.";" <AbstractText>Previous studies have suggested a role for pathogens as a trigger of systemic sclerosis (SSc), although neither a pathogen nor a mechanism of pathogenesis is known. Here we show enrichment of Rhodotorula sequences in the skin of patients with early, diffuse SSc compared with that in normal controls. RNA-seq was performed on four SSc patients and four controls, to a depth of 200 million reads per patient. Data were analyzed to quantify the nonhuman sequence reads in each sample. We found little difference between bacterial microbiome and viral read counts, but found a significant difference between the read counts for a mycobiome component, R. glutinis. Normal samples contained almost no detected R. glutinis or other Rhodotorula sequence reads (mean score 0.021 for R. glutinis, 0.024 for all Rhodotorula). In contrast, SSc samples had a mean score of 5.039 for R. glutinis (5.232 for Rhodotorula). We were able to assemble the D1-D2 hypervariable region of the 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of R. glutinis from each of the SSc samples. Taken together, these results suggest that R. glutinis may be present in the skin of early SSc patients at higher levels than in normal skin, raising the possibility that it may be triggering the inflammatory response found in SSc. </AbstractText> "

To study protein function, we used morpholino-mediated knockdowns in zebrafish and short hairpin RNA knockdowns in U937 cells cultured with human dermal endothelial cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">All nine patients carried recessively inherited mutations in CECR1 (cat eye syndrome chromosome region, candidate 1), encoding adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2), that were predicted to be deleterious; these mutations were rare or absent in healthy controls. Six patients were compound heterozygous for eight CECR1 mutations, whereas the three patients with polyarteritis nodosa or small-vessel vasculitis were homozygous for the p.Gly47Arg mutation. Patients had a marked reduction in the levels of ADA2 and ADA2-specific enzyme activity in the blood. Skin, liver, and brain biopsies revealed vasculopathic changes characterized by compromised endothelial integrity, endothelial cellular activation, and inflammation. Knockdown of a zebrafish ADA2 homologue caused intracranial hemorrhages and neutropenia - phenotypes that were prevented by coinjection with nonmutated (but not with mutated) human CECR1.

"673";"24520335";"Integration of sequence data from a Consanguineous family with genetic data from an outbred population identifies PLB1 as a candidate rheumatoid arthritis risk gene.";" <AbstractText>Integrating genetic data from families with highly penetrant forms of disease together with genetic data from outbred populations represents a promising strategy to uncover the complete frequency spectrum of risk alleles for complex traits such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Here, we demonstrate that rare, low-frequency and common alleles at one gene locus, phospholipase B1 (PLB1), might contribute to risk of RA in a 4-generation consanguineous pedigree (Middle Eastern ancestry) and also in unrelated individuals from the general population (European ancestry). Through identity-by-descent (IBD) mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a non-synonymous c.2263G&gt;C (p.G755R) mutation at the PLB1 gene on 2q23, which significantly co-segregated with RA in family members with a dominant mode of inheritance (P = 0.009). We further evaluated PLB1 variants and risk of RA using a GWAS meta-analysis of 8,875 RA cases and 29,367 controls of European ancestry. We identified significant contributions of two independent non-coding variants near PLB1 with risk of RA (rs116018341 [MAF = 0.042] and rs116541814 [MAF = 0.021], combined P = 3.2 × 10(-6)). Finally, we performed deep exon sequencing of PLB1 in 1,088 RA cases and 1,088 controls (European ancestry), and identified suggestive dispersion of rare protein-coding variant frequencies between cases and controls (P = 0.049 for C-alpha test and P = 0.055 for SKAT). Together, these data suggest that PLB1 is a candidate risk gene for RA. Future studies to characterize the full spectrum of genetic risk in the PLB1 genetic locus are warranted.</AbstractText> "

To identify some pathogenic variants associated with severe Behçet's uveitis, we used targeted and massively parallel sequencing methods to explore the genetic diversity of target regions. A solution-based target enrichment kit was designed to capture whole-exonic regions of 132 candidate genes. Using a multiplexing strategy, 32 samples from patients with a severe type of Behçet's uveitis were sequenced with a Genome Analyzer IIx. We compared the frequency of each variant with that of 59 normal Korean controls, and selected five rare and eight common single-nucleotide variants as the candidates for a replication study. The selected variants were genotyped in 61 cases and 320 controls and, as a result, two rare and seven common variants showed significant associations with severe Behçet's uveitis (P&lt;0.05). Some of these, including rs199955684 in KIR3DL3, rs1801133 in MTHFR, rs1051790 in MICA and rs1051456 in KIR2DL4, were predicted to be damaging by either the PolyPhen-2 or SIFT prediction program. Variants on FCGR3A (rs396991) and ICAM1 (rs5498) have been previously reported as susceptibility loci of this disease, and those on IFNAR1, MTFHR and MICA also replicated the previous reports at the gene level. The KIR3DL3 and KIR2DL4 genes are novel susceptibility genes that have not been reported in association with BD. In conclusion, this study showed that target enrichment and next-generation sequencing technologies can provide valuable information on the genetic predisposition for Behçet's uveitis. </AbstractText> "

RNA-Seq is a powerful technique for the interrogation of large numbers of transcripts including nonprotein coding RNAs. The aim of the study was to characterise molecular mechanisms associated with age-related changes in gene signatures.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">RNA for gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq and real-time PCR analysis was isolated from macroscopically normal cartilage of the metacarpophalangeal joints of eight horses; four young donors (4 years old) and four old donors (&gt;15 years old). RNA sequence libraries were prepared following ribosomal RNA depletion and sequencing was undertaken using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Differentially expressed genes were defined using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction with a generalised linear model likelihood ratio test (P &lt; 0.05, expression ratios ± 1.4 log₂ fold-change). Ingenuity pathway analysis enabled networks, functional analyses and canonical pathways from differentially expressed genes to be determined.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">In total, the expression of 396 transcribed elements including mRNAs, small noncoding RNAs, pseudogenes, and a single microRNA was significantly different in old compared with young cartilage (± 1.4 log2 fold-change, P &lt; 0.05). Of these, 93 were at higher levels in the older cartilage and 303 were at lower levels in the older cartilage. There was an over-representation of genes with reduced expression relating to extracellular matrix, degradative proteases, matrix synthetic enzymes, cytokines and growth factors in cartilage derived from older donors compared with young donors. In addition, there was a reduction in Wnt signalling in ageing cartilage.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">There was an age-related dysregulation of matrix, anabolic and catabolic cartilage factors.

"677";"23716478";"Developmental dysplasia of the hip: linkage mapping and whole exome sequencing identify a shared variant in CX3CR1 in all affected members of a large multigeneration family.";" <AbstractText>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a debilitating condition characterized by incomplete formation of the acetabulum leading to dislocation of the femur, suboptimal joint function, and accelerated wear of the articular cartilage resulting in arthritis. DDH affects 1 in 1000 newborns in the United States; there are well-defined &quot;pockets&quot; of high prevalence in Japan, and in Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Although reasonably accurate for detecting gross forms of hip dysplasia, existing techniques fail to find milder forms of dysplasia. Undetected hip dysplasia is the leading cause of osteoarthritis of the hip in young individuals, causing over 40% of cases in this age group. A sensitive and specific test for DDH has remained a desirable yet elusive goal in orthopedics for a long time. A 72-member, four-generation affected family has been recruited, and DNA from its members retrieved. Genomewide linkage analysis revealed a 2.61-Mb candidate region (38.7-41.31 Mb from the p term of chromosome 3) co-inherited by all affected members with a maximum logarithm (base 10) of odds (LOD) score of 3.31. Whole exome sequencing and analysis of this candidate region in four severely affected family members revealed one shared variant, rs3732378, that causes a threonine (polar) to methionine (non-polar) alteration at position 280 in the transmembrane domain of CX3CR1. This mutation is predicted to have a deleterious effect on its encoded protein, which functions as a receptor for the ligand fractalkine. By Sanger sequencing this variant was found to be present in the DNA of all affected individuals and obligate heterozygotes. CX3CR1 mediates cellular adhesive and migratory functions and is known to be expressed in mesenchymal stem cells destined to become chondrocytes. A genetic risk factor that might be among the etiologic factors for the family in this study has been identified, along with other possible aggravating mutations shared by four severely affected family members. These findings might illuminate the molecular pathways affecting chondrocyte maturation and bone formation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</CopyrightInformation> "

IRF5 expression is significantly upregulated in SLE patients and upregulation associates with IRF5-SLE risk haplotypes. IRF5 alternative splicing has also been shown to be elevated in SLE patients. Given that human IRF5 exists as multiple alternatively spliced transcripts with distinct function(s), it is important to determine whether the IRF5 transcript profile expressed in healthy donor immune cells is different from that expressed in SLE patients. Moreover, it is not currently known whether an IRF5-SLE risk haplotype defines the profile of IRF5 transcripts expressed. Using standard molecular cloning techniques, we identified and isolated 14 new differentially spliced IRF5 transcript variants from purified monocytes of healthy donors and SLE patients to generate an IRF5 variant transcriptome. Next-generation sequencing was then used to perform in-depth and quantitative analysis of full-length IRF5 transcript expression in primary immune cells of SLE patients and healthy donors by next-generation sequencing. Evidence for additional alternatively spliced transcripts was obtained from de novo junction discovery. Data from these studies support the overall complexity of IRF5 alternative splicing in SLE. Results from next-generation sequencing correlated with cloning and gave similar abundance rankings in SLE patients thus supporting the use of this new technology for in-depth single gene transcript profiling. Results from this study provide the first proof that 1) SLE patients express an IRF5 transcript signature that is distinct from healthy donors, 2) an IRF5-SLE risk haplotype defines the top four most abundant IRF5 transcripts expressed in SLE patients, and 3) an IRF5 transcript signature enables clustering of SLE patients with the H2 risk haplotype.</AbstractText> "

"685";"22563483";"Concordant signaling pathways produced by pesticide exposure in mice correspond to pathways identified in human Parkinson's disease.";" <AbstractText>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the etiology of 90 percent of the patients is unknown. Pesticide exposure is a major risk factor for PD, and paraquat (PQ), pyridaben (PY) and maneb (MN) are amongst the most widely used pesticides. We studied mRNA expression using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) in the ventral midbrain (VMB) and striatum (STR) of PQ, PY and paraquat+maneb (MNPQ) treated mice, followed by pathway analysis. We found concordance of signaling pathways between the three pesticide models in both the VMB and STR as well as concordance in these two brain areas. The concordant signaling pathways with relevance to PD pathogenesis were e.g. axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as well as pathways not previously linked to PD, e.g. basal cell carcinoma, human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Human PD pathways previously identified by expression analysis, concordant with VMB pathways identified in our study were axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, IL-6 signaling, ephrin receptor signaling, TGF-β signaling, PPAR signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Human PD pathways concordant with the STR pathways in our study were Wnt/β-catenin signaling, axonal guidance signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (Ppard) and G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) were common genes in VMB and STR identified by network analysis. In conclusion, the pesticides PQ, PY and MNPQ elicit common signaling pathways in the VMB and STR in mice, which are concordant with known signaling pathways identified in human PD, suggesting that these pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD. The analysis of these networks and pathways may therefore lead to improved understanding of disease pathogenesis, and potential novel therapeutic targets.</AbstractText> "

Clones with a frequency of over 0.5% were considered to be highly expanded clones (HEC).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">In early RA synovium, the T-cell repertoire was dominated by 35 HEC (median, range 2-70) accounting for 56% of the TCR sequenced. The clonal dominance in the synovium was patient specific and significantly greater than in established RA (median of 11 HEC (range 5-24) in established RA synovium accounting for 9.8% of T cells; p&lt;0.01). 34% (range 28-40%) of the most expanded T-cell clones were shared between different joints in the same patients, compared with only 4% (range 0-8%) between synovium and blood (p=0.01).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In RA, a systemic autoimmune disease, the inflamed synovium forms a niche for specific expanded T-cell clones, especially in early disease. This suggests that, at least in RA, autoreactive T cells should be addressed specifically in the inflamed tissue, preferably in the early phase of the disease.</AbstractText> "
"688";"21983786";"Identification of low-frequency variants associated with gout and serum uric acid levels.";" <AbstractText>We tested 16 million SNPs, identified through whole-genome sequencing of 457 Icelanders, for association with gout and serum uric acid levels. Genotypes were imputed into 41,675 chip-genotyped Icelanders and their relatives, for effective sample sizes of 968 individuals with gout and 15,506 individuals for whom serum uric acid measurements were available. We identified a low-frequency missense variant (c.1580C&gt;G) in ALDH16A1 associated with gout (OR = 3.12, P = 1.5 × 10(-16), at-risk allele frequency = 0.019) and serum uric acid levels (effect = 0.36 s.d., P = 4.5 × 10(-21)). We confirmed the association with gout by performing Sanger sequencing on 6,017 Icelanders. The association with gout was stronger in males relative to females. We also found a second variant on chromosome 1 associated with gout (OR = 1.92, P = 0.046, at-risk allele frequency = 0.986) and serum uric acid levels (effect = 0.48 s.d., P = 4.5 × 10(-16)). This variant is close to a common variant previously associated with serum uric acid levels. This work illustrates how whole-genome sequencing data allow the detection of associations between low-frequency variants and complex traits.</AbstractText> "
