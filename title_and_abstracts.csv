"1";"32271837";"A population-specific low-frequency variant of SLC22A12 (p.W258*) explains nearby genome-wide association signals for serum uric acid concentrations among Koreans.";" <AbstractText>Prolonged hyperuricemia is a cause of gout and an independent risk factor for chronic health conditions including diabetes and chronic kidney diseases. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations have repeatedly confirmed genetic loci including those encoding uric acid transporters such as ABCG2 and SLC9A2. However, many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in GWASs have been common variants with small effects and unknown functions. In addition, there is still much heritability to be explained. To identify the causative genetic variants for SUA concentrations in Korean subjects, we conducted a GWAS (1902 males) and validation study (2912 males and females) and found four genetic loci reaching genome-wide significance on chromosomes 4 (ABCG2) and 11 (FRMD8, EIF1AD and SLC22A12-NRXN2). Three loci on chromosome 11 were distributed within a distance of 1.3 megabases and they were in weak or moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) states (r2 = 0.02-0.68). In a subsequent association analysis on the GWAS loci of chromosome 11 using closely positioned markers derived from whole genome sequencing data, the most significant variant to be linked with the nearby GWAS signal was rs121907892 (c.774G&gt;A, p.W258*) of the SLC22A12 gene. This variant, and each of the three GWAS SNPs, were in LD (r2 = 0.06-0.32). The strength of association of SNPs with SUA concentration (negative logarithm of P-values) and the genetic distance (r2 of LD) between rs121907892 and the surrounding SNPs showed a quantitative correlation. This variant has been found only in Korean and Japanese subjects and is known to lower the SUA concentration in the general population. Thus, this low-frequency variant, rs121907892, known to regulate SUA concentrations in previous studies, is responsible for the nearby GWAS signals.</AbstractText> "

Whilst disease specific autoantibodies are useful diagnostically, our understanding of the pathogenic B cell repertoire remains unclear. Defining it would lead to novel insights and curative treatments. To address this, we have undertaken the largest study to date of over 150 RA patients, utilizing next generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze up to 200,000 BCR sequences per patient. The full-length antigen-binding variable region of the heavy chain (IgGHV) of the IgG B cell receptor (BCR) were sequenced. Surprisingly, RA patients do not express particular clonal expansions of B cells at diagnosis. Rather they express a polyclonal IgG repertoire with a significant increase in BCRs that have barely mutated away from the germline sequence. This pattern remains even after commencing disease modifying therapy. These hypomutated BCRs are expressed by TNF-alpha secreting IgG<sup>+ve</sup>CD27<sup>-ve</sup> B cells, that are expanded in RA peripheral blood and enriched in the rheumatoid synovium. A similar B cell repertoire is expressed by patients with Sjögren's syndrome. A rate limiting step in the initiation of autoimmunity is the activation of B cells and this data reveals that a sizeable component of the human autoimmune B cell repertoire consists of polyclonal, hypomutated IgG<sup>+ve</sup> B cells, that may play a critical role in driving chronic inflammation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Cowan, Miles, Capitani, Giguere, Johnsson, Goodyear, McInnes, Breusch, Gray and Gray.</CopyrightInformation> "

The cell morphology, immunophenotype, self-renewal, multi-differentiation, and cell migration of these CPCs were evaluated. Additionally, the distributions of CD105<sup>+</sup>/CD271<sup>+</sup> cells in OA osteochondral specimen were determined. Furthermore, a high-throughput mRNA sequencing was performed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Migratory CPCs (mCPCs) robustly outgrew from mildly collagenases-digested osteoarthritic cartilages. The mCPCs from grade 3-4 cartilages (mCPCs, grades 3-4) harbored morphological characteristics, cell proliferation, and colony formation capacity that were similar to those of the mCPCs from the grade 1-2 OA cartilages (mCPCs, grades 1-2). However, the mCPCs (grades 3-4) highly expressed CD271. In addition, the mCPCs (grades 3-4) showed enhanced osteo-adipogenic activities and decreased chondrogenic capacity. Furthermore, the mCPCs (grades 3-4) exhibited stronger cell migration in response to osteoarthritis synovial fluids. More CD105<sup>+</sup>/CD271<sup>+</sup> cells resided in grade 3-4 articular cartilages. Moreover, the results of mRNA sequencing showed that mCPCs (grades 3-4) expressed higher migratory molecules.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our data suggest that more mCPCs (grades 3-4) migrate to injured articular cartilages but with enhanced osteo-adipogenic and decreased chondrogenic capacity, which might explain the pathological changes of mCPCs during the progression of OA from early to late stages. Thus, these dysfunctional mCPCs might be optional cell targets for OA therapies.</AbstractText> "

We reported a case with a loss-of-function mutation in DNASE1L3, a gene described previously in families with systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, the patient showed a novel homozygous missense variant in DOCK8, a gene known to be responsible for the hyper-IgE recurrent infection syndrome (HIES). A 3-year-old girl born to consanguine parents presented with chronic urticarial rash, hemolytic anemia, pulmonary hemorrhage, and hypovolemic shock findings. She had a low hemoglobin level, a positive direct antiglobulin test, antinuclear antibody and anti-double stranded DNA, low C3 and C4, third-degree tricuspid regurgitation, and severe enlargement of the right ventricle on echocardiography, suggesting pulmonary embolism. Despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin, pulse metilprednisolone, rituximab, and supportive treatment for shock, the patient died on the seventh day. Whole-exome sequencing indicated a homozygous stop variant c.537G&gt;A (p. Trp179Ter) in DNASE1L3. In addition, a possibly pathogenic homozygous missense variant in the HIES gene DOCK8 was detected. The occurrence of potentially clinically relevant, genetic variants in several genes posed various challenges with respect to diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis.</AbstractText> "

For the study, total number of 182 patients with FMF disease were enrolled and screening of a panel of genes , called &quot;fever panel&quot; which comprises 17 genes, was performed. The most common mutations in MEFV gene were homozygous M694V missense mutation (4.3%) and R202Q missense mutation (4.9%). The most common heterozygous mutations were R202Q (26.5%), M694V (25.9%) and E148Q (11.9%). Compound heterozygous and homozygous mutations were also detected. Also, different types of mutations were identified in NOD2, CARD14, NLRP12, NLRP3, NLRP7, IL1RN, LPIN2, TNFRSF1A, MVK and PSTPIP1 genes. Two novel missense variations in the MEFV gene, Gln34Pro and Ile247Val, which have not been previously reported in the databases, were identified. Also, Thr91Ile missense variation in the NOD2 gene, Gly461Cys missense variation in NLRP3 and Tyr732Stop nonsense variation in LPIN2 were firstly identified. The results of the current study suggest that in addition to the MEFV gene which has an important roles in FMF, molecular screening of other genes related to other autoinflammatory diseases might provide support in suspected cases and provide detailed information about the course of the disease.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

"8";"32179818";"The Transcription Factor-microRNA Regulatory Network during hESC-chondrogenesis.";" <AbstractText>Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) offer a promising therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis (OA). The unlimited source of cells capable of differentiating to chondrocytes has potential for repairing damaged cartilage or to generate disease models via gene editing. However their use is limited by the efficiency of chondrogenic differentiation. An improved understanding of the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of chondrogenesis will enable us to improve hESC chondrogenic differentiation protocols. Small RNA-seq and whole transcriptome sequencing was performed on distinct stages of hESC-directed chondrogenesis. This revealed significant changes in the expression of several microRNAs including upregulation of known cartilage associated microRNAs and those transcribed from the Hox complexes, and the downregulation of pluripotency associated microRNAs. Integration of miRomes and transcriptomes generated during hESC-directed chondrogenesis identified key functionally related clusters of co-expressed microRNAs and protein coding genes, associated with pluripotency, primitive streak, limb development and extracellular matrix. Analysis identified regulators of hESC-directed chondrogenesis such as miR-29c-3p with 10 of its established targets identified as co-regulated 'ECM organisation' genes and miR-22-3p which is highly co-expressed with ECM genes and may regulate these genes indirectly by targeting the chondrogenic regulators SP1 and HDAC4. We identified several upregulated transcription factors including HOXA9/A10/D13 involved in limb patterning and RELA, JUN and NFAT5, which have targets enriched with ECM associated genes. We have developed an unbiased approach for integrating transcriptome and miRome using protein-protein interactions, transcription factor regulation and miRNA target interactions and identified key regulatory networks prominent in hESC chondrogenesis.</AbstractText> "

"11";"32142504";"The Association Between MUC5B Mutations and Clinical Outcome in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease: A Retrospective Exploratory Study in China.";" <AbstractText>BACKGROUND Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who develop interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD), show features of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). This retrospective exploratory clinical study aimed to investigate the association between mutations in the MUC5B gene and clinical outcome in patients with RA, with or without RA-ILD, using whole-exome sequencing (WES). MATERIAL AND METHODS WES was performed using peripheral blood samples for mutations in the MUC5B gene in 51 patients diagnosed with RA without ILD, and 45 patients with RA-ILD. The cumulative incidence in acute exacerbations of RA-ILD and variables associated with acute exacerbations of RA-ILD were analyzed. RESULTS In patients with RA-ILD, the main genetic variants of MUC5B were identified, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.410 (p=0.013). Nine patients with RA without ILD (17.6%) and 19 patients with RA-ILD (42.2%) expressed MUC5B variants. Patients with RA-ILD carrying MUC5B variants had a significantly increased duration of RA-ILD (p=0.03) and showed a UIP pattern on lung HRCT (p=0.01). Acute exacerbations of RA-ILD occurred in 25 patients during follow-up, including 13 patients with mutant MUC5B and 12 patients with wildtype MUC5B. Univariate analysis showed that MUC5B mutations (p=0.043), older age of onset of RA (p=0.041), increased serum anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) (p=0.033), and a UIP imaging pattern on HRCT (p=0.015) were significantly correlated with acute exacerbations of RA-ILD. However, these findings were not supported by multivariate analysis (p=0.065). CONCLUSIONS The carrier status of MUC5B variants was an indicator of reduced prognosis and increased exacerbations of RA-ILD.</AbstractText> "

Intra-articular delivery of purified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from MRL/MpJ &quot;superhealer&quot; mice increased bone volume during repair and prevents post-traumatic arthritis. Recently, although extracellular vesicles released from MSCs have been used widely for treating OA, the application of extracellular vesicles secreted by CPCs from MRL/MpJ mice in OA therapy has never been reported. In this study, we evaluated the effects of extracellular vesicles secreted by CPCs from control CBA (CBA-EVs) and MRL/MpJ mice (MRL-EVs) on proliferation and migration of murine chondrocytes. We also determined here if weekly intra-articular injections of CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs would repair and regenerate surgically induced model in mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">CPC surface markers were detected by flow cytometry. CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs were isolated using an ultrafiltration method. Nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and western blots were used to identify extracellular vesicles. CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs were injected intra-articularly in a mouse model of surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced OA, and histological and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to assess the efficacy of exosome injections. We used miRNA-seq analysis to analyze the expression profiles of exosomal miRNAs derived from CBA-EVs as well as MRL-EVs. Cell-counting and scratch assays were used to evaluate the effects of CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs on proliferation and migration of murine chondrocytes, respectively. Meanwhile, a specific RNA inhibitor assesses the roles of the candidate miRNAs in CPC-EV-induced regulation of function of chondrocytes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Both CBA-EVs and MRL-EVs stimulated chondrocyte proliferation and migration, but MRL-EVs exerted a stronger effect than CBA-EVs. The similar result was also observed in in vivo study, which indicated that injecting either CBA-EVs or MRL-EVs attenuated OA, but MRL-EVs showed a superior therapeutic effect in comparison with CBA-EVs. The results of bioinformatics analyses revealed that the differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs participated in multiple biological processes. We identified 80 significantly upregulated and 100 downregulated miRNAs. Moreover, we found that the top 20 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs connected OA repair to processes such as AMPK signaling, regulation of autophagy, and insulin signaling. Notably, miRNA 221-3p were highly enriched in MRL-Exos and treatment with miR 221-3p inhibitor markedly decreased chondrocyte proliferation and migration induced by CBA-EVs or MRL-EVs in vitro.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This is the first study to demonstrate MRL-EVs had a greater therapeutic effect on the treatment of OA than CBA-EVs.

Systematically addressing T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires of different CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets could help understand RA pathogenesis. Here, peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from treatment-naïve RA patients and healthy controls were sorted into seven subsets including naïve, effector, central memory, effector memory (EMT), Th1, Th17, and regulatory T cells. T-cell receptor β chain repertoires were then analyzed by next-generation sequencing. We identified T-cell clonal expansion in EMT and Th17 cells of RA patients, with highly similar TCR repertoires. Ex vivo experiments demonstrated the preferred differentiation from EMT to Th17 cells in RA. Notably, we showed that TCR diversity and abundance of differentiated T cells of Th17 were significantly correlated with RA disease activity. Based on these observations, we propose that abnormal differentiation from EMT to Th17 and expansion of Th17 play pivotal role in RA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In the general community, the disease is largely polygenic in genetic architecture, with many polymorphisms having been identified in gout or urate-associated traits. In a small proportion of cases, rare high penetrant mutations associated with monogenic segregation of the disease in families have been demonstrated to be disease causative. In this study, we recruited a two-generation pedigree with early-onset gout. To elucidate the genetic predisposition, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. After comprehensive variant analyses and cosegregation testing, we identified a missense variant (c.277C&gt;A, p.L93M) in <i>SLC16A9</i>, an extremely rare variant in genetic databases. Moreover, in silico assessments showed strong pathogenicity. This variant cosegregated with the disease phenotype perfectly in the family and is located in a highly conserved functional domain. A few studies supported our results of the association between <i>SLC16A9</i> and gout and serum urate levels. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence for the association of rare missense in <i>SLC16A9</i> with early-onset gout. These findings not only expand our current understanding of gout but also may have further implications for the treatment and prevention of gout.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Xiu-Feng Huang et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

In rheumatoid arthritis, leukocyte-derived cytokines TNF and IL-17A work together, activating fibroblasts to become a dominant source of the hallmark cytokine IL-6. However, IL-17A alone has minimal effect on fibroblasts. To identify key mediators of the synergistic response to TNF and IL-17A in human synovial fibroblasts, we performed time series, dose-response, and gene-silencing transcriptomics experiments. Here we show that in combination with TNF, IL-17A selectively induces a specific set of genes mediated by factors including cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) and IκBζ (NFKBIZ). In the promoters of <i>CXCL1</i>, <i>CXCL2</i>, and <i>CXCL3</i>, we found a putative CUX1-NF-κB binding motif not found elsewhere in the genome. CUX1 and NF-κB p65 mediate transcription of these genes independent of LIFR, STAT3, STAT4, and ELF3. Transcription of <i>NFKBIZ</i>, encoding the atypical IκB factor IκBζ, is IL-17A dose-dependent, and IκBζ only mediates the transcriptional response to TNF and IL-17A, but not to TNF alone. In fibroblasts, IL-17A response depends on CUX1 and IκBζ to engage the NF-κB complex to produce chemoattractants for neutrophil and monocyte recruitment.</AbstractText> "
"16";"32071274";"New Pathogenesis Mechanisms and Translational Leads Identified by Multidimensional Analysis of Necrotizing Myositis in Primates.";" <AbstractText>A fundamental goal of contemporary biomedical research is to understand the molecular basis of disease pathogenesis and exploit this information to develop targeted and more-effective therapies. Necrotizing myositis caused by the bacterial pathogen <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> is a devastating human infection with a high mortality rate and few successful therapeutic options. We used dual transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomes of <i>S. pyogenes</i> and host skeletal muscle recovered contemporaneously from infected nonhuman primates. The <i>in vivo</i> bacterial transcriptome was strikingly remodeled compared to organisms grown <i>in vitro</i>, with significant upregulation of genes contributing to virulence and altered regulation of metabolic genes. The transcriptome of muscle tissue from infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) differed significantly from that of mock-infected animals, due in part to substantial changes in genes contributing to inflammation and host defense processes. We discovered significant positive correlations between group A streptococcus (GAS) virulence factor transcripts and genes involved in the host immune response and inflammation. We also discovered significant correlations between the magnitude of bacterial virulence gene expression <i>in vivo</i> and pathogen fitness, as assessed by previously conducted genome-wide transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS). By integrating the bacterial RNA-seq data with the fitness data generated by TraDIS, we discovered five new pathogen genes, namely, <i>S. pyogenes</i> 0281 (<i>Spy0281</i> [<i>dahA</i>]), <i>ihk-irr</i>, <i>slr</i>, <i>isp</i>, and <i>ciaH</i>, that contribute to necrotizing myositis and confirmed these findings using isogenic deletion-mutant strains. Taken together, our study results provide rich new information about the molecular events occurring in severe invasive infection of primate skeletal muscle that has extensive translational research implications.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Necrotizing myositis caused by <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> has high morbidity and mortality rates and relatively few successful therapeutic options. In addition, there is no licensed human <i>S. pyogenes</i> vaccine. To gain enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of this infection, we employed a multidimensional analysis strategy that included dual RNA-seq and other data derived from experimental infection of nonhuman primates. The data were used to target five streptococcal genes for pathogenesis research, resulting in the unambiguous demonstration that these genes contribute to pathogen-host molecular interactions in necrotizing infections. We exploited fitness data derived from a recently conducted genome-wide transposon mutagenesis study to discover significant correlation between the magnitude of bacterial virulence gene expression <i>in vivo</i> and pathogen fitness. Collectively, our findings have significant implications for translational research, potentially including vaccine efforts.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Kachroo et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

Accordingly, JAK inhibitors compose a new class of drugs, among which tofacitinib and baricitinib have been approved for the treatment of RA. Periarticular bone erosions contribute considerably to the pathogenesis of RA. However, although the immunomodulatory aspect of JAK inhibition (JAKi) is well defined, the current knowledge of how JAKi influences bone homeostasis is limited. Here, we assessed the effects of the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib on bone phenotype (i) in mice during steady-state conditions or in mice with bone loss induced by (ii) estrogen-deficiency (ovariectomy) or (iii) inflammation (arthritis) to evaluate whether effects of JAKi on bone metabolism require noninflammatory/inflammatory challenge. In all three models, JAKi increased bone mass, consistent with reducing the ratio of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand/osteoprotegerin in serum. In vitro, effects of tofacitinib and baricitinib on osteoclast and osteoblast differentiation were analyzed. JAKi significantly increased osteoblast function (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) but showed no direct effects on osteoclasts. Additionally, mRNA sequencing and ingenuity pathway analyses were performed in osteoblasts exposed to JAKi and revealed robust up-regulation of markers for osteoblast function, such as osteocalcin and Wnt signaling. The anabolic effect of JAKi was illustrated by the stabilization of β-catenin. In humans with RA, JAKi induced bone-anabolic effects as evidenced by repair of arthritic bone erosions. Results support that JAKi is a potent therapeutic tool for increasing osteoblast function and bone formation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

There is evidence for a predominance of macrophages with an inflammatory phenotype (M1) in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium. MicroRNAs (miRs) play a pivotal role in regulating the inflammatory response in innate immune cells and are found at dysregulated levels in RA patients. Here we explored miRs that tune the inflammatory function of M2-macrophages. <b>Methods:</b> Expression profiles of miR-221-3p and miR-155-5p were analyzed in clinical samples from RA, other inflammatory arthritis (OIA), osteoarthritis (OA), and healthy donors (HD) by qPCR. <i>In vitro</i> generated macrophages were transfected with miR-mimics and inhibitors. Transcriptome profiling through RNA-sequencing was performed on M2-macrophages overexpressing miR-221-3p mimic with or without LPS treatment. Secretion of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-8, and CXCL13 was measured in M1- and M2-macrophages upon TLR2/TLR3/TLR4-stimulation using ELISA. Inflammatory pathways including NF-κB, IRF3, MAPKs, and JAK3/STAT3 were evaluated by immunoblotting. Direct target interaction of miR-221-3p and predicted target sites in 3'UTR of JAK3 were examined by luciferase reporter gene assay. <b>Results:</b> miR-221-3p in synovial tissue and fluid was increased in RA vs. OA or OIA. Endogenous expression levels of miR-221-3p and miR-155-5p were higher in M1- than M2-macrophages derived from RA patients or HD. TLR4-stimulation of M1- and M2-macrophages resulted in downregulation of miR-221-3p, but upregulation of miR-155-5p. M2-macrophages transfected with miR-221-3p mimics secreted less IL-10 and CXCL13 but more IL-6 and IL-8, exhibited downregulation of JAK3 protein and decreased pSTAT3 activation. JAK3 was identified as new direct target of miR-221-3p in macrophages. Co-transfection of miR-221-3p/miR-155-5p mimics in M2-macrophages increased M1-specific IL-12 secretion. <b>Conclusions:</b> miR-221-3p acts as a regulator of TLR4-induced inflammatory M2-macrophage function by directly targeting JAK3. Dysregulated miR-221-3p expression, as seen in synovium of RA patients, leads to a diminished anti-inflammatory response and drives M2-macrophages to exhibit a M1-cytokine profile.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Quero, Tiaden, Hanser, Roux, Laski, Hall and Kyburz.</CopyrightInformation> "

However, population-specific HLA imputation references are essential for achieving high imputation accuracy. In this study, a subset of 1012 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) who underwent both whole-genome SNP array and NGS-based HLA typing were used to establish Taiwanese HLA imputation references. The HIBAG package was used to generate the imputation references for eight HLA loci at a two- and three-field resolution. Internal validation was carried out to evaluate the call threshold and accuracy for each HLA gene. HLA class II genes found to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were validated in this study by the imputed HLA alleles. Our Taiwanese population-specific references achieved average HLA imputation accuracies of 98.11% for two-field and 98.08% for three-field resolution. The frequency distribution of imputed HLA alleles among 23,972 TWB subjects were comparable with PCR-based HLA alleles in general Taiwanese reported in the allele frequency net database. We replicated four common HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03:01, DRB1*04:05, DQA1*03:03, and DQB1*04:01) significantly associated with RA. The population-specific references provide an informative tool to investigate the associations of HLA variants and human diseases in large-scale population-based studies.</AbstractText> "

Here we report an 11-year-old girl with a history of repeated episodes of fever, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and urticarial rash in the trunk and limbs. Chest and pelvic X-Ray, sacroiliac joints MRI, brain MRI and abdominal CT scan were normal. Anti-nuclear antibody, Rheumatoid factor, cryoglobulin, ANCA/PR3, p-ANCA/MPO, anti-smooth muscle antibody and anti-mitochondrial antibody were negative. Serology for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV viruses was negative. Serum immunoglobulins were in the normal range. Genetic analysis for familial Mediterranean fever syndrome was negative. Whole exome sequencing was carried out to identify the genetic cause of our patient. We identified a homozygous missense variant (c.579C &gt; G, p. His193Gln) in exon 7 of the PLCG2 gene. Bioinformatic analysis and clinical symptoms suggests this variant to be pathogenic in the homozygous state for APLAID and thus probably acting in an autosomal recessive manner. Our bioinformatic analysis also showed this novel mutation to have detrimental effects on the 3D structure of the PLCG2 protein, which is well conserved among many other similar species.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020.

Both parents were tested and were normal. The third child had mild hypotonia at infancy, which improved later. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed the three boys carried a likely benign variant in MED12, inherited from the healthy, asymptomatic mother. The father suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and was on chemotherapy during the conception of the first two affected boys. This report places emphasis on the use of a chromosomal microarray in patients with ID, even with familial cases, and reports the paternal use of methotrexate.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020, Alhashem et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

Notably, KD is more prevalent in males than females. We previously established a key role for IL (interleukin)-1 signaling in KD pathogenesis, but whether this pathway underlies the sex-based difference in susceptibility is unknown. Approach and Results: The role of IL-1 signaling was investigated in the <i>Lactobacillus casei</i> cell wall extract-induced experimental mouse model of KD vasculitis. Five-week-old male and female mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS, <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>cell wall extract, or a combination of <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>cell wall extract and the IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra. Aortitis, coronary arteritis inflammation score and abdominal aorta dilatation, and aneurysm development were assessed. mRNA-seq (messenger RNA sequencing) analysis was performed on abdominal aorta tissue. Publicly available human transcriptomics data from patients with KD was analyzed to identify sex differences and disease-associated genes. Male mice displayed enhanced aortitis and coronary arteritis as well as increased incidence and severity of abdominal aorta dilatation and aneurysm, recapitulating the increased incidence in males that is observed in human KD. Gene expression data from patients with KD and abdominal aorta tissue of <i>Lactobacillus casei</i>cell wall extract-injected mice showed enhanced <i>Il1b</i> expression and IL-1 signaling genes in males. Although the more severe IL-1β-mediated disease phenotype observed in male mice was ameliorated by Anakinra treatment, the milder disease phenotype in female mice failed to respond.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">IL-1β may play a central role in mediating sex-based differences in KD, with important implications for the use of anti-IL-1β therapies to treat male and female patients with KD.</AbstractText> "

An immune dysregulation syndrome associated with heterozygous germline mutations in CTLA4 was recently reported. Clinical features include recurrent infections, systemic lymphadenopathy, various autoimmune conditions, hypogammaglobulinemia, and autosomal dominant inheritance, characteristic of primary immunodeficient disease (PID). PID symptoms are variable and few patients with sporadic de novo CTLA4 germline mutations have been described. Here, we report the case of a 26-year-old man with an immune dysregulation syndrome and a de novo CTLA4 germline mutation. The patient exhibited several clinical features associated with PID. Next-generation sequencing revealed a CTLA4 germline mutation, c.436G&gt;A; p.G146R, in exon 2 of CTLA4. Sanger sequencing confirmed the patient was the only member of his family with this germline mutation. The patient was diagnosed with an immune dysregulation syndrome associated with de novo germline CTLA4 mutation, complicated by steroid-refractory rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with abatacept, a CTLA4-immunoglobulin fusion molecule, was initiated, resulting in dramatic resolution of the patient's clinical symptoms. As PID with CTLA4 germline mutation is rare and patients may be under-diagnosed, physicians should be aware of the features of PID.</AbstractText> "

The BCR repertoires in 12 subjects including eight SSc patients and four healthy controls were characterized by high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis were studied. The average CDR3 length in the SSc group was significantly shorter. The SSc patient displayed more diverse BCR. Moreover, SSc patients with mild skin sclerosis, anti-Scl70, interstitial lung disease or female sex were more diversified. B cells from the SSc patients showed a differential V and J gene usage. SSc patients had distinct BCR repertoires.These findings reflected the differences of BCR repertoires between SSc patients and controls.

The mechanisms of JD pathogenesis are not fully understood, but it is known that MAP subverts the host immune system by using macrophages as its primary reservoir. MAP infection in macrophages is often studied in healthy cows or experimentally infected calves, but reports on macrophages from naturally infected cows are lacking. In our study, primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from cows diagnosed as positive (+) or negative (-) for JD were challenged <i>in vitro</i> with live MAP. Analysis using next-generation RNA sequencing revealed that macrophages from JD(+) cows did not present a definite pattern of response to MAP infection. Interestingly, a considerable number of genes, up to 1436, were differentially expressed in JD(-) macrophages. The signatures of the infection time course of 1, 4, 8, and 24 h revealed differential expression of <i>ARG2, COL1A1, CCL2, CSF3, IL1A, IL6, IL10, PTGS2, PTX3, SOCS3, TNF</i>, and <i>TNFAIP6</i> among other genes, with major effects on host signaling pathways. While several immune pathways were affected by MAP, other pathways related to hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation, lipid homeostasis, such as LXR/RXR (liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor) activation pathways, and autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis or atherosclerosis) also responded to the presence of live MAP. Comparison of the profiles of the unchallenged MDMs from JD(+) vs. JD(-) cows showed that 868 genes were differentially expressed, suggesting that these genes were already affected before monocytes differentiated into macrophages. The downregulated genes predominantly modified the general cell metabolism by downregulating amino acid synthesis and affecting cholesterol biosynthesis and other energy production pathways while introducing a pro-fibrotic pattern associated with foam cells. The upregulated genes indicated that lipid homeostasis was already supporting fat storage in uninfected JD(+) MDMs. For JD(+) MDMs, differential gene expression expounds long-term mechanisms established during disease progression of paratuberculosis. Therefore, MAP could further promote disease persistence by influencing long-term macrophage behavior by using both tolerance and fat-storage states. This report contributes to a better understanding of MAP's controls over the immune cell response and mechanisms of MAP survival.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2020 Ariel, Gendron, Dudemaine, Gévry, Ibeagha-Awemu and Bissonnette.</CopyrightInformation> "

Yet, very little is known about how aging and injury interact and contribute to OA pathogenesis. In the present study, we examined age- and injury-related molecular changes in mouse knee joints that could contribute to OA. Using RNA-seq, first we profiled the knee joint transcriptome of 10-week-old, 62-week-old, and 95-week-old mice and found that the expression of several inflammatory-response related genes increased as a result of aging, whereas the expression of several genes involved in cartilage metabolism decreased with age. To determine how aging impacts post-traumatic arthritis (PTOA) development, the right knee joints of 10-week-old and 62-week-old mice were injured using a non-invasive tibial compression injury model and injury-induced structural and molecular changes were assessed. At six-week post-injury, 62-week-old mice displayed significantly more cartilage degeneration and osteophyte formation compared with young mice. Although both age groups elicited similar transcriptional responses to injury, 62-week-old mice had higher activation of inflammatory cytokines than 10-week-old mice, whereas cartilage/bone metabolism genes had higher expression in 10-week-old mice, suggesting that the differential expression of these genes might contribute to the differences in PTOA severity observed between these age groups.</AbstractText> "

The objective was to further pinpoint genetic differences between prognosis subgroups in relation to the HLA markers. Whole-exome sequencing was conducted for 72 patients selected based on disease activity (resolved disease, <i>n</i> = 36; persistent disease, <i>n</i> = 36).

The Finnish exome data from the Genome Aggregation Database was used as a control population in the WES sample. Statistical analyses included single-variant analysis for common variants and gene level analysis for rare variants. We attempted to replicate associated variants in 181 Finnish sarcoidosis patients and 150 controls. An association was found in chromosome 1p36.21 (AADACL3 and C1orf158), which has recently been associated with sarcoidosis in another WES study. In our study, variations in these genes were associated with resolved disease (AADACL3, <i>p</i> = 0.0001 and <i>p</i> = 0.0003; C1orf158, <i>p</i> = 7.03E-05).

In this study, we explored the expression of EZH2, an H3K27me3 transferase, in human OA cartilages and its roles in regulating OA pathogenesis. Here, we found EZH2 was highly expressed in both mice and human OA cartilage samples by using histological analysis and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The medial meniscectomy (MMx) OA model results indicated the conditional knockout of Ezh2 deteriorated OA pathological conditions. Furthermore, we showed the positive role of Ezh2 in cartilage wound healing and inhibition of hypertrophy through activating TNFSF13B, a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. Further, we also indicated that the effect of TNFSF13B, increased by Ezh2, might boost the healing of chondrocytes through increasing the phosphorylation of Akt. Taken together, our results uncovered an EZH2-positive subpopulation existed in OA patients, and that EZH2-TNFSF13B signaling was responsible for regulating chondrocyte healing and hypertrophy.

Studies have shown that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of RA. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) represent one important group of epigenetic regulators. However, the role of individual HDAC members for the pathogenesis of arthritis is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate that mice with a T cell-specific deletion of HDAC1 (HDAC1-cKO) are resistant to the development of Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), whereas the antibody response to collagen type II was undisturbed, indicating an unaltered T cell-mediated B cell activation. The inflammatory cytokines IL-17 and IL-6 were significantly decreased in sera of HDAC1-cKO mice. IL-6 treated HDAC1-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells showed an impaired upregulation of CCR6. Selective inhibition of class I HDACs with the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 under Th17-skewing conditions inhibited the upregulation of chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) in mouse and human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Accordingly, analysis of human RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data and histological analysis of synovial tissue samples from human RA patients revealed the existence of CD4<sup>+</sup>CCR6<sup>+</sup> cells with enhanced HDAC1 expression.

Furthermore, both ACPA<sup>+</sup> and ACPA<sup>-</sup> RA patients had significantly higher total serum IgA and IgM compared to controls, based on serology of larger cohorts (n = 3494 IgA; n = 397 IgM). The observed elevated Ig-levels, distortion in IgM<sup>+</sup> B cells, increase in double negative B cells, change in B-cell markers, and elevation of unmutated IgG<sup>+</sup> B cells suggests defects in B-cell tolerance in RA. This may represent an underlying cause of increased polyreactivity and autoimmunity in RA.</AbstractText> "

However, clinical translation has proven difficult. Here, we hypothesized that one reason could be that inflammatory responses in peripheral blood are different from those in the arthritic joint.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We performed meta-analysis of gene expression microarray data from synovium, whole blood cells (WBC), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and CD4+ T cells from patients with RA and healthy controls in order to identify overlapping pathways, upstream regulators and potential biomarkers. We also analyzed single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from peripheral blood and whole joints from a mouse model of antigen-induced arthritis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Analyses of two profiling data sets from synovium from RA patients and healthy controls all showed significant activation of pathways with known pathogenic relevance, such as the Th1 pathway, the role of NFAT in regulation of the immune response, dendritic cell maturation, iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis, interferon signaling, Cdc42 signaling, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated apoptosis. The most activated upstream regulators included TNF, an important drug target, as well as IFN-gamma and CD40LG, all of which are known to play important pathogenic roles in RA. The differentially expressed genes from synovium included several potential biomarkers, such as CCL5, CCL13, CCL18, CX3CL1, CXCL6, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, IL15, IL32, IL1RN, SPP1, and TNFSF11. By contrast, microarray studies of WBC, PBMC and CD4+ T cells showed variable pathways and limited pathway overlap with synovium. Similarly, scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of arthritis did not support that inflammatory responses in peripheral blood reflect those in the arthritic joints. These data showed pathway overlap between mouse joint cells and synovium from patients with RA, but not with cells in peripheral blood.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings indicate a dichotomy between gene expression changes, pathways, upstream regulators and biomarkers in synovium and cell types in peripheral blood, which complicates identification of biomarkers in blood.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The major IRF5-SLE risk haplotype is common across populations, yet immune functions for the risk haplotype are undefined. We characterized the global immune phenotype of healthy donors homozygous for the major risk and nonrisk haplotypes and identified cell lineage-specific alterations that mimic presymptomatic SLE. Contrary to previous studies in B lymphoblastoid cell lines and SLE immune cells, IRF5 genetic variants had little effect on IRF5 protein levels in healthy donors. Instead, we detected basal IRF5 hyperactivation in the myeloid compartment of risk donors that drives the SLE immune phenotype. Risk donors were anti-nuclear antibody positive with anti-Ro and -MPO specificity, had increased circulating plasma cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and had enhanced spontaneous NETosis. The IRF5-SLE immune phenotype was conserved over time and probed mechanistically by ex vivo coculture, indicating that risk neutrophils are drivers of the global immune phenotype. RNA-Seq of risk neutrophils revealed increased IRF5 transcript expression, IFN pathway enrichment, and decreased expression of ROS pathway genes. Altogether, the data support that individuals carrying the IRF5-SLE risk haplotype are more susceptible to environmental/stochastic influences that trigger chronic immune activation, predisposing to the development of clinical SLE.</AbstractText> "

Chronic interferon (IFN) signaling and cytokine dysregulation may identify diseases with available targeted treatments.METHODSSixty-six consecutively referred USAID patients underwent underwent screening for the presence of an interferon signature using a standardized type-I IFN-response-gene score (IRG-S), cytokine profiling, and genetic evaluation by next-generation sequencing.RESULTSThirty-six USAID patients (55%) had elevated IRG-S. Neutrophilic panniculitis (40% vs. 0%), basal ganglia calcifications (46% vs. 0%), interstitial lung disease (47% vs. 5%), and myositis (60% vs. 10%) were more prevalent in patients with elevated IRG-S. Moderate IRG-S elevation and highly elevated serum IL-18 distinguished 8 patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) and recurrent macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Among patients with panniculitis and progressive cytopenias, 2 patients were compound heterozygous for potentially novel LRBA mutations, 4 patients harbored potentially novel splice variants in IKBKG (which encodes NF-κB essential modulator [NEMO]), and 6 patients had de novo frameshift mutations in SAMD9L. Of additional 12 patients with elevated IRG-S and CANDLE-, SAVI- or Aicardi-Goutières syndrome-like (AGS-like) phenotypes, 5 patients carried mutations in either SAMHD1, TREX1, PSMB8, or PSMG2. Two patients had anti-MDA5 autoantibody-positive juvenile dermatomyositis, and 7 could not be classified. Patients with LRBA, IKBKG, and SAMD9L mutations showed a pattern of IRG elevation that suggests prominent NF-κB activation different from the canonical interferonopathies CANDLE, SAVI, and AGS.CONCLUSIONSIn patients with elevated IRG-S, we identified characteristic clinical features and 3 additional autoinflammatory diseases: IL-18-mediated PAP and recurrent MAS (IL-18PAP-MAS), NEMO deleted exon 5-autoinflammatory syndrome (NEMO-NDAS), and SAMD9L-associated autoinflammatory disease (SAMD9L-SAAD). The IRG-S expands the diagnostic armamentarium in evaluating USAIDs and points to different pathways regulating IRG expression.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT02974595.FUNDINGThe Intramural Research Program of the NIH, NIAID, NIAMS, and the Clinical Center.</AbstractText> "

"41";"31856670";"Measuring consistency among gene set analysis methods: A systematic study.";" <AbstractText>Gene set analysis is a quantitative approach for generating biological insight from gene expression datasets. The abundance of gene set analysis methods speaks to their popularity, but raises the question of the extent to which results are affected by the choice of method. Our systematic analysis of 13 popular methods using 6 different datasets, from both DNA microarray and RNA-Seq origin, shows that this choice matters a great deal. We observed that the overall number of gene sets reported by each method differed by up to 2 orders of magnitude, and there was a bias toward reporting large gene sets with some methods. Furthermore, there was substantial disagreement between the 20 most statistically significant gene sets reported by the methods. This was also observed when expanding to the 100 most statistically significant reported gene sets. For different datasets of the same phenotype/condition, the top 20 and top 100 most significant results also showed little to no agreement even when using the same method. GAGE, PAGE, and ORA were the only methods able to achieve relatively high reproducibility when comparing the 20 and 100 most statistically significant gene sets. Biological validation on a juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) dataset showed wide variation in terms of the relevance of the top 20 and top 100 most significant gene sets to known biology of the disease, where GAGE predicted the most relevant gene sets, followed by GSEA, ORA, and PAGE.</AbstractText> "

The clinical and laboratory data, treatment protocols, and outcome of the patients were recorded from the patients' medical charts. ADA2 gene was screened by next generation sequencing first and then verified by Sanger sequencing. Serum ADA2 enzyme activity was measured by modified spectrophotometric method.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The median (min-max) age at onset of symptoms and age at diagnosis were 11 (9-13.8) years and 15 (9-19) years, respectively. The median (min-max) follow-up period was 8 (6-45) months. There was consanguinity in two families (2/3). The main clinical manifestations are musculoskeletal (5/5), dermatological (4/5), and neurological (2/5). Homozygosity for the p.G47R mutation in ADA2 gene was detected in three patients. A homozygous mutation in ADA2 gene (c.650 T &gt; A; p.Val217Asp) was detected in two siblings. Plasma ADA2 enzymatic activity was absent in all patients. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy was commenced, and all patients became clinically inactive with normal acute-phase reactants.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">ADA2 mutations should be checked in patients with presence of inflammation and livedoid vasculitis when they have neurological findings, especially in the form of stroke; and a history suggesting for an inherited disease; or presence of resistance to conventional treatment.

Potential importance in immune-related processes, gene ontology, pathway enrichment and overlap analyses were performed to prioritise gene sets.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A range from 1 to 50 rare possible pathogenic variants, including 39 variants in immune-related genes across SLE, RA and pSS families, were identified. Among this gene set, regulation of T cell activation (p=4.06×10<sup>-7</sup>) and T cell receptor (TCR) signalling pathway (p=1.73×10<sup>-6</sup>) were particularly concentrated, including <i>PTPRC</i> (<i>CD45</i>), <i>LCK</i>, <i>LAT-SLP76</i> complex genes (<i>THEMIS</i>, <i>LAT</i>, <i>ITK</i>, <i>TEC</i>, <i>TESPA1</i>, <i>PLCL1)</i>, <i>DGKD</i>, <i>PRKD1</i>, <i>PAK2</i> and <i>NFAT5</i>, shared across 14 SLE, RA and pSS families.

The disease primarily presents with recurrent infections, and patients may also present with inflammatory conditions, including noninfectious colitis, and an increased frequency of autoimmunity. We report here a patient with CGD in whom the presentation, unlike the classical presentation of CGD, was predominantly of an inflammatory and autoimmune phenotype.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Case presentation"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">A 3-year-old Pakistani female presented with bloody diarrhea since the age of 7 days, followed by the development of perianal abscesses and fistula. There was no other history of recurrent infections. The patient subsequently developed joint pain and stiffness with persistently elevated inflammatory markers and elevated anti-cyclic citrullinate peptide (anti-CCP) antibody titer. She was diagnosed with oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and colitis. The diagnosis of CGD was later made and was based on the absence of NADPH oxidase activity in the patient's neutrophils upon phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation using the dihydrorhodamine-1,2,3 (DHR) flow cytometry test. Targeted next-generation sequencing revealed an unreported deletion mutation in exon 10 as a homozygous loss-of-function variant of the human neutrophil oxidase factor 2 (<i>NCF2</i>) (<i>NCF2</i>: NM_001190789, nucleotide change: c.855_856del:p.T285fs).

This case is important due to its rarity and because it might represent a previously undiscovered mutation, which is possibly more common in the patient's ethnic group. Other mutations in <i>NCF2</i> have been linked to inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmunity, but without CGD, suggesting similarities in the pathogenesis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2019.</CopyrightInformation> "

He developed arthritis in his right metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints without precursor pneumonia. In the joint aspirate, <i>S. aureus</i> was detected through culture. The existence of <i>L. micdadei</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> were indicated by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and confirmed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis.

Here we describe a case of a 10-years-old girl with a history of soft tissue swelling involving the third digit of left hand, bilateral wrists and ankles. Pathology of the finger mass revealed abundant multinucleated giant cells consistent with GCTTS. Resection of the tendinous masses from the ankles also showed multinucleated giant cells along with chronic bursitis. She began to show features of polyarticular arthritis by age 7. Due to progression of arthritis, whole exome sequencing was performed and found a <i>de novo</i> heterozygous mutation in <i>NOD2</i> (p. R334Q). This variant is the most common mutation responsible for early onset sarcoidosis (EOS)/Blau syndrome, an autoinflammatory disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation of joints, skin and eyes. The early onset of symptoms and presence of multinucleated giant cells and granuloma in this case are in keeping with a diagnosis of EOS/Blau syndrome. The patient responded well to treatment with methotrexate and etanercept. This case extends the clinical spectrum of EOS/Blau syndrome, which should be considered for GCTTS and other unusual presentations of tendon inflammation in children, even in the absence of the characteristic triad of arthritis, dermatitis and uveitis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Zheng, Lee, Huang, Wang and Li.</CopyrightInformation> "

Although joints are the primary targets for JIA, a synovial fluid-based miRNA signature has never been studied. We aim to identify miRNA biomarkers in JIA by comparing synovial fluid and serum samples from children with JIA and <i>K.</i><i>kingae</i> septic arthritis (SA). With next-generation high-throughput sequencing, we measured the absolute levels of 2083 miRNAs in synovial fluid and serum from an exploratory cohort of children and validated differentially expressed miRNAs in a replication study by using RT-qPCR. We identified a 19-miRNA signature only in synovial fluid samples that was significantly deregulated, with at least 2-fold change in expression, in JIA versus SA (p &lt; 0.01). The combination of miR-6764-5p, miR-155, and miR-146a-5p expression in synovial fluid yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 1 (95% CI 0.978 to 1), thereby perfectly differentiating JIA from SA in children. We propose, for the first time, a synovial fluid-specific miRNA signature for JIA and associated signaling pathways that may indicate potential biomarkers to assist in the classification and differential diagnosis of JIA and help in understanding JIA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> "

RNA-sequence (RNA-Seq) analysis was used to interrogate the changes in gene expression in PIA rats, which identified 617 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PIA synovial tissue of diseased rats. Upstream regulator analysis showed upregulation of gene expression pathways regulated by TNF, IL1B, IL6, proinflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) involved in RA. In contrast, ligand-dependent nuclear receptors like the liver X-receptors NR1H2 and NR1H3 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) were downregulated in arthritic synovia. Daily RTD-1 treatment of PIA rats for 1-5 days following disease presentation modulated 340 of the 617 disease genes, and synovial gene expression in PIA rats treated 5 days with RTD-1 closely resembled the gene signature of naive synovium. Systemic RTD-1 inhibited proinflammatory upstream regulators such as TNF, IL1, and IL6 and activated antiarthritic ligand-dependent nuclear receptor pathways, including PPARG, NR1H2, and NR1H3, that were suppressed in untreated PIA rats. RTD-1 also inhibited proinflammatory responses in IL-1β-stimulated human RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in vitro and diminished expression of human orthologs of disease genes that are induced in rat PIA synovium. Thus, the antiarthritic mechanisms of systemic RTD-1 include homeostatic regulation of arthritogenic gene networks in a manner that correlates temporally with clinical resolution of rat PIA.</AbstractText> "

The molecular pathways by which B cells become pathogenic PC secreting autoantibodies in SLE are incompletely characterized. Histone deactylase 6 (HDAC6) is a unique cytoplasmic HDAC that modifies the interaction of a number of tubulin- associated proteins; inhibition of HDAC6 has been shown to be beneficial in murine models of SLE, but the downstream pathways accounting for the therapeutic benefit have not been clearly delineated. In the current study, we sought to determine whether selective HDAC6 inhibition would abrogate abnormal B cell activation in SLE. We treated NZB/W lupus mice with the selective HDAC6 inhibitor, ACY-738, for 4 weeks beginning at 20 weeks-of age. After only 4 weeks of treatment, manifestation of lupus nephritis (LN) were greatly reduced in these animals. We then used RNAseq to determine the genomic signatures of splenocytes from treated and untreated mice and applied computational cellular and pathway analysis to reveal multiple signaling events associated with B cell activation and differentiation in SLE that were modulated by HDAC6 inhibition. PC development was abrogated and germinal center (GC) formation was greatly reduced. When the HDAC6 inhibitor-treated lupus mouse gene signatures were compared to human lupus patient gene signatures, the results showed numerous immune, and inflammatory pathways increased in active human lupus were significantly decreased in the HDAC6 inhibitor treated animals. Pathway analysis suggested alterations in cellular metabolism might contribute to the normalization of lupus mouse spleen genomic signatures, and this was confirmed by direct measurement of the impact of the HDAC6 inhibitor on metabolic activities of murine spleen cells. Taken together, these studies show HDAC6 inhibition decreases B cell activation signaling pathways and reduces PC differentiation in SLE and suggest that a critical event might be modulation of cellular metabolism.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Ren, Catalina, Eden, Liao, Read, Luo, McMillan, Hulver, Jarpe, Bachali, Grammer, Lipsky and Reilly.</CopyrightInformation> "

IL-17A+CD8+ (Tc17) T cells are enriched in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with PsA, and IL-17A blockade is clinically efficacious in PsA/SpA. This study was undertaken to determine the immunophenotype, molecular profile, and function of synovial Tc17 cells in order to elucidate their role in PsA/SpA pathogenesis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Peripheral blood (PB) and SF mononuclear cells were isolated from patients with PsA or other types of SpA. Cells were phenotypically, transcriptionally, and functionally analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 6-18), T cell receptor β (TCRβ) sequencing (n = 3), RNA-Seq (n = 3), quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (n = 4), and Luminex or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (n = 4-16).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">IL-17A+CD8+ T cells were predominantly TCRαβ+ and their frequencies were increased in the SF versus the PB of patients with established PsA (P &lt; 0.0001) or other SpA (P = 0.0009). TCRβ sequencing showed that these cells were polyclonal in PsA (median clonality 0.08), while RNA-Seq and deep immunophenotyping revealed that PsA synovial Tc17 cells had hallmarks of Th17 cells (RORC/IL23R/CCR6/CD161) and Tc1 cells (granzyme A/B). Synovial Tc17 cells showed a strong tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cell signature and secreted a range of proinflammatory cytokines. We identified CXCR6 as a marker for synovial Tc17 cells, and increased levels of CXCR6 ligand CXCL16 in PsA SF (P = 0.0005), which may contribute to their retention in the joint.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results identify synovial Tc17 cells as a polyclonal subset of Trm cells characterized by polyfunctional, proinflammatory mediator production and CXCR6 expression. The molecular signature and functional profiling of these cells may help explain how Tc17 cells can contribute to synovial inflammation and disease persistence in PsA and possibly other types of SpA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, The Authors.

Gait behaviours of the mice were monitored at different ages. Spontaneous synovial joint destruction was evaluated by digital radiographic imaging and μCT analysis; changes of articular cartilage and synovitis were determined by histological analysis. The recruitment of macrophages in the synovium was examined by immunostaining and monocyte trafficking assay. RNA-seq analysis, Western blotting and chemotaxis experiment were performed on control and FGFR3-deficient macrophages. The peripheral blood from non-osteoarthritis (OA) donors and patients with OA were analysed. Mice were treated with neutralising antibody against CXCR7 to investigate the role of CXCR7 in arthritis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">R3cKO mice but not control mice developed spontaneous cartilage destruction in multiple synovial joints at the age of 13 months. Moreover, the synovitis and macrophage accumulation were observed in the joints of 9-month-old R3cKO mice when the articular cartilage was not grossly destructed. FGFR3 deficiency in myeloid cells also aggravated joint destruction in DMM mouse model. Mechanically, FGFR3 deficiency promoted macrophage chemotaxis partly through activation of NF-κB/CXCR7 pathway. Inhibition of CXCR7 could significantly reverse FGFR3-deficiency-enhanced macrophage chemotaxis and the arthritic phenotype in R3cKO mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study identifies the role of FGFR3 in synovial macrophage recruitment and synovitis, which provides a new insight into the pathological mechanisms of inflammation-related arthritis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Increasing evidence suggests that both genetic susceptibilities and changes in DNA methylation influence pivotal biological pathways and thereby contribute to the disease. The role of DNA methylation in SSc has not been fully elucidated, because existing investigations of DNA methylation predominantly focused on nucleotide CpGs within restricted genic regions, and were performed on samples containing mixed cell types.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on purified CD4+ T lymphocytes from nine SSc patients and nine controls in a pilot study, and then profiled genome-wide cytosine methylation as well as genetic variations. We adopted robust statistical methods to identify differentially methylated genomic regions (DMRs). We then examined pathway enrichment associated with genes located in these DMRs. We also tested whether changes in CpG methylation were associated with adjacent genetic variation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We profiled DNA methylation at more than three million CpG dinucleotides genome-wide. We identified 599 DMRs associated with 340 genes, among which 54 genes exhibited further associations with adjacent genetic variation. We also found these genes were associated with pathways and functions that are known to be abnormal in SSc, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, skin lesion formation and progression, and angiogenesis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The CD4+ T cell DNA cytosine methylation landscape in SSc involves crucial genes in disease pathogenesis. Some of the methylation patterns are also associated with genetic variation. These findings provide essential foundations for future studies of epigenetic regulation and genome-epigenome interaction in SSc.</AbstractText> "

However, the role of circRNAs in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> We initially used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to comprehensively analyze circRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 SLE patients, stratified by their disease activity characteristics (stable or active SLE), and 10 healthy controls (HCs). Candidate circRNAs identified were first validated by quantitative reverse-transcription (qRT)-PCR in PBMC samples from a training-phase cohort of five SLE patients and five HCs. The significantly dysregulated circRNAs were then confirmed by qRT-PCR in a validation cohort of 23 SLE patients and 21 HCs, and in an external validation cohort with 64 SLE patients, 58 HCs, and 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In addition, we conducted bioinformatics analysis and western blotting investigating the relationships between the candidate circRNAs and SLE progression. <b>Results:</b> Multilayer integrative analysis of circRNA regulation showed that 84 circRNAs were upregulated and 30 were downregulated in patients with SLE compared with HCs. We then analyzed the intersection of these differentially expressed circRNAs in an SLE-stable cohort, an SLE-active cohort, and HCs. This enabled us to narrow down dysregulated circRNAs to 15 upregulated circRNAs. Only hsa_circ_0000479 was significantly upregulated in PBMCs of patients with SLE compared with HCs (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the diagnostic potential of hsa_circ_0000479 expression to distinguish SLE patients from HCs and RA patients was also significantly increased in the validation-phase and external-validation-phase cohorts (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). When distinguishing SLE patients from HCs, the diagnostic specificities of hsa_circ_0000479 were 0.619 and 1.0 in two validation cohorts, respectively (AUCs = 0.731 and 0.730, respectively). It was also significantly increased in either stable SLE patients or active SLE patients compared with HCs in these two cohorts (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). We also used bioinformatics analysis to show that hsa_circ_0000479 regulates SLE progression by modulating metabolic pathways and the Wnt signaling pathway. Western blotting revealed that the expression of Wnt-16 protein was significantly decreased in SLE. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results suggest that hsa_circ_0000479 has potential as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis of SLE.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Guo, Wang, Ye, Shi, Yan, Lin, Huang, Li, Lin, Zhu, Xue and Zhang.</CopyrightInformation> "

Since its discovery, the phenotypic spectrum of DADA2 has substantially expanded to cover Diamond-Blackfan anaemia, cytopenia and immunodeficiency syndromes. In addition to elevated TNF alpha levels, increased levels of interferon-stimulated genes were also detected in patients with DADA2. Given the absence of clinical trials until now, no standard treatment strategy exists for DADA2. Currently, anti-TNF alpha agents are the mainstay of treatment, based on the data both from the initial two reports and from subsequent studies. However, it is still unclear how to manage asymptomatic patients with ADA2 mutation and/or with absent ADA2 activity and what is the optimal duration of anti-TNF therapy.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""SUMMARY"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Among a total of 206 DADA2 patients described so far, the overall mortality was found as 8.3%. Biallelic homozygous G47R mutations were mostly associated with a vascular phenotype, whereas patients with homozygous R169Q mutations seem to display a mixed clinical phenotype including vascular, haematological and immunological manifestations. HSCT should be reserved as a curative treatment option for DADA2 patients unresponsive to the anti-TNF therapy, as it carries a significant morbidity.</AbstractText> "

Two studies have revealed the aberrant circRNA expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by microarrays. However, due to the intrinsic defects of microarrays, such as their inability to detect unidentified circRNAs, we examined the circRNA expression profiles in the PBMCs from four RA patients and three healthy controls by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and further explored the value of circRNAs in diagnosing RA. The results showed 71 markedly dysregulated circRNAs, including 41 upregulated and 30 downregulated circRNAs; these data included several previously unidentified candidate circRNAs. Gene Ontology and pathway annotation revealed that the most altered pathways and genes were associated with inflammation and transcriptional activity, such as the TNF pathway. The selected dysregulated circRNAs were verified by qRT-PCR in the PBMCs of 32 RA patients and 20 healthy controls, and the results indicated that hsa_circ_0000396 and hsa_circ_0130438 were downregulated in the RA group versus the healthy group, consistent with the RNA-seq data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated the diagnostic value of both circRNAs for RA. Our results identified aberrant dysregulated circRNAs in RA patients, including several identified circRNAs, and the diagnostic value of circRNAs for RA, suggesting the superiority of RNA-seq versus microarrays for screening differentially expressed circRNAs and further strengthening the potential diagnostic value of circRNAs for the diagnosis of RA.</AbstractText> "

The predominant pathology (23 of 36) was pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and/or endogenous lipoid pneumonia (PAP/ELP), with atypical features including regional involvement and concomitant vascular changes. Apparent severe delayed drug hypersensitivity occurred in some cases. The 5-year survival was 42%. Whole exome sequencing (20 of 61) did not identify a novel monogenic defect or likely causal PAP-related or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)-related mutations.

Histological analysis revealed a significant reduction in OA severity in c/c mice compared with +/+ at 2 weeks post-DMM. This chondroprotective effect in c/c mice was associated with a higher ambient level of BiP protein prior to DMM and a delay in chondrocyte apoptosis. RNA-seq analysis suggested Xbp1-regulated networks to be significantly enriched in c/c mice at 2 weeks post-DMM. Compromising the ER through genetically ablating Atf6α, a key ER stress sensor, had no effect on DMM-induced OA severity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our studies indicate that an increased capacity to effectively manage increases in ER stress in articular cartilage due either to pre-conditioning as a result of prior exposure to ER stress or to genetic pre-disposition may be beneficial in delaying the onset of OA, but once established, ER stress plays no significant role in disease progression.</AbstractText> "

The microbiome is the collection of microbes (microbiota) and their genes. Recent breakthroughs in the high-throughput sequencing technologies have made it possible for us to understand the composition of the human microbiome. Launched by the National Institutes of Health in USA, the human microbiome project indicated that our bodies harbor a wide array of microbes, specific to each body site with interpersonal and intrapersonal variabilities. Numerous studies have indicated that several factors influence the development of the microbiome including genetics, diet, use of antibiotics, and lifestyle, among others. The microbiome and its mediators are in a continuous cross talk with the host immune system; hence, any imbalance on one side is reflected on the other. Dysbiosis (microbiota imbalance) was shown in many diseases and pathological conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and cancer. The microbial composition mirrors inflammation variations in certain disease conditions, within various stages of the same disease; hence, it has the potential to be used as a biomarker.</AbstractText> "

Control shRNA plasmids and lnc-ITSN1-2 shRNA plasmids were transfected into RA FLS, and then cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines expressions were evaluated. Subsequently, mRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were conducted, and rescue experiment of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) mRNA overexpression on alleviating the functions of lnc-ITSN1-2 was performed. Additionally, lnc-ITSN1-2 and NOD2 mRNA expressions in synovial tissue in 30 RA patients and 15 controls were measured. Lnc-ITSN1-2 expression was increased in RA FLS compared with normal FLS. Lnc-ITSN1-2 knockdown inhibited RA FLS proliferation and inflammation while promoted RA FLS apoptosis. mRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses revealed 144 upregulated and 98 downregulated genes by lnc-ITSN1-2 knockdown, which were enriched in regulating inflammatory responses and cytokines related pathways. NOD2 was selected for rescue experiment, which disclosed that upregulating NOD2 alleviated the effect of lnc-ITSN1-2 knockdown on cell proliferation, apoptosis and inflammation in RA FLS. In addition, synovial tissue lnc-ITSN1-2 positively associated with NOD2 mRNA, and both of them positively correlated with disease risk, inflammation and activity of RA. Downregulation of lnc-ITSN1-2 correlates with decreased disease risk and activity of RA, and reduces RA FLS proliferation and inflammation via regulating NOD2/RIP2 signaling pathway.</AbstractText> "

"71";"31461658";"Molecular Portraits of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Identify Clinical and Treatment Response Phenotypes.";" <AbstractText>There is a current imperative to unravel the hierarchy of molecular pathways that drive the transition of early to established disease in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Herein, we report a comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis of the molecular pathways that drive early RA progression in the disease tissue (synovium), comparing matched peripheral blood RNA-seq in a large cohort of early treatment-naive patients, namely, the Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort (PEAC). We developed a data exploration website (https://peac.hpc.qmul.ac.uk/) to dissect gene signatures across synovial and blood compartments, integrated with deep phenotypic profiling. We identified transcriptional subgroups in synovium linked to three distinct pathotypes: fibroblastic pauci-immune pathotype, macrophage-rich diffuse-myeloid pathotype, and a lympho-myeloid pathotype characterized by infiltration of lymphocytes and myeloid cells. This is suggestive of divergent pathogenic pathways or activation disease states. Pro-myeloid inflammatory synovial gene signatures correlated with clinical response to initial drug therapy, whereas plasma cell genes identified a poor prognosis subgroup with progressive structural damage.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Both the diseases are linked by the overproduction of IL-1.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We report on the case of two siblings affected by recurrent attacks of fever, oral aphthous stomatitis, abdominal pain, arthritis, undefined dermatitis at the hands, associated with increased AST, ALT, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum amyloid A, leucocytosis with neutrophilia. Infectious diseases were excluded. The genetic study for Familial Mediterranean Fever, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, Mevalonate kinase deficiency, showed the homozygous mutation p.M680I of exon 10 in MEFV. Their parents were heterozygous for the same mutation p.M680I, however, the mother showed severe symptoms of FMF (recurrent attacks of fever, arthralgia and arthritis, abdominal pain, thoracic pain), the father showed recurrent pustulosis prevalent on the hands and limbs, with arthralgia and abdominal pain. Both the patients started colchicine, with an improvement in clinical manifestations and a reduction of serum amyloid A. For the atypical dermatologic signs present in the two siblings and in the father, the study of other autoinflammatory syndromes was performed with next generation sequencing and showed the heterozygous rare missense mutation of unknown significance: p.(Val408Ile) of PSTPIP1 gene in the two siblings and in the mother, the father was negative.

Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering revealed distinct methylation signatures in RA with methylation aberrations noted across chromosomes. Methylation alterations varied with CpG features and genic characteristics. Typically, CpG islands and CpG shores were hypermethylated and displayed the greatest methylation variance. Promoters were hypermethylated and enhancers/gene bodies were hypomethylated, with methylation variance associated with expression variance. RA genetically associated genes preferentially displayed differential methylation and differential expression or interacted with differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes. These differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes were enriched with several signaling pathways and disease categories. 10 genes (<i>CD86, RAB20, XAF1</i>, <i>FOLR3, LTBR</i>, <i>KCNH8</i>, <i>DOK7, PDGFA, PITPNM2, CELSR1</i>) with concomitantly differential methylation in enhancers/promoters/gene bodies and differential expression in B cells were validated. This integrated analysis of methylome and transcriptome identified novel epigenetic signatures associated with RA and highlighted the interaction between genetics and epigenetics in RA. These findings help our understanding of the pathogenesis of RA and advance epigenetic studies in regards to the disease.</AbstractText> "

The inflammation of the synovium can be observed in both of the two diseases. Synovial fibroblasts (SFs) play an important role in the inflammatory process of the synovium. The functional states of synovial fibroblasts are heterogeneous, and the detailed transition process of their functional states is still unclear. By using transcriptomic data of SFs at a single-cell level, we found a similar transition process for SFs in RA and OA. We also identified the potential regulatory effects of the WNT signaling pathway, the TGF-<i>β</i> signaling pathway, the Fc<i>ε</i>RI signaling pathway, and the ERBB signaling pathway on modifying the SFs' functional state. These findings indicate potentially overlapped pathogenic mechanisms in these two diseases, which may help uncover new therapeutic targets to ameliorate disease progression.</AbstractText> "

Differential expression of mRNA and miRNA was integrated with interaction analysis, functional annotation, regulatory network mapping and experimentally verified miRNA-target interaction data, further validated with microarray expression profiles. In this study, 3049 upregulated mRNA and 3552 downregulated mRNA, together with 50 upregulated miRNA and 35 downregulated miRNA in RASF were identified. Interaction analysis highlighted contribution of miRNA to altered transcriptome. Functional annotation revealed metabolic deregulation and oncogenic signatures of RASF. Regulatory network mapping identified downregulated FOXO1 as master transcription factor resulting in altered transcriptome of RASF. Differential expression in three miRNA and corresponding targets (hsa-miR-31-5p:WASF3, hsa-miR-132-3p:RB1, hsa-miR-29c-3p:COL1A1) were also validated. The interactions of these three miRNA-target genes were experimentally validated with past literature.

The research aims to investigate the roles of Circ_0136474/miR-127-5p/MMP-13 axis in OA. Differentially expressed circRNAs and miRNAs in OA cartilage tissue were screened out and visualized by R project based on RNA-seq data and microarray data respectively. qRT-PCR was carried out for detection of relative expression levels of Circ_0136474, miR-127-5p, MMP-13 and other inflammatory factors and Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the protein expression level of MMP-13. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were conducted to determine cell proliferation and cell apoptotic ability respectively. RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) experiments were conducted to confirm the immune-localization of the Circ_0136474 and MMP-13 in human tissues. Targeted relationships were predicted by bioinformatic analysis and verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Our findings revealed that the expression levels of both Circ_0136474 and MMP-13 in OA cartilage tissue were significantly higher than that in normal cartilage tissue. Circ_0136474 could suppress cell proliferation by facilitating MMP-13 expression and suppressing miR-127-5p expression in OA. Overexpression of miR-127-5p negatively regulated MMP-13 expression to enhance cell proliferation.

However, the mechanism underlying this condition has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to explore how moxibustion reduced arthritis by regulating Treg/Th17 cell imbalance and the role of differentiation-associated keynote microRNAs (miRNAs). Moxibustion therapy was administered to mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The arthritis index, histopathological changes, inflammatory factors, and Treg/Th17 cell balance were analyzed. MiRNAs from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed based on the RNA-seq technology. Treg/Th17 cell differentiation-related miRNAs and their target genes were identified from the online database of miRDB, TargetScan, and miRTarBase. The expression of miRNAs and their target genes was verified by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The binding sites of miRNAs and target genes were predicted by miRDB, and the targeting relationship between them was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Arthritis in mice with CIA was reduced by moxibustion therapy, and Treg/Th17 cell imbalance was regulated. Seventeen upregulated and twenty-three downregulated miRNAs were identified in moxibustion-treated mice. Seven upregulated miRNAs, seven downregulated miRNAs, and five Treg/Th17 cell differentiation-associated target genes were predicted. Among them, miR-144-3p and <i>Hif1a</i> were suggested to be the keynote miRNA and target gene, respectively, regulating the Treg/Th17 cell differentiation. In conclusions, moxibustion therapy plays a possible regulatory function in rebalancing Treg/Th17 cells by regulating miR-144-3p and its target gene <i>Hif1a</i> to treat CIA.</AbstractText> "

However, both the exact origin and the role of macrophages in inflammatory joint disease remain unclear. Here we use fate-mapping approaches in conjunction with three-dimensional light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and single-cell RNA sequencing to perform a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of the composition, origin and differentiation of subsets of macrophages within healthy and inflamed joints, and study the roles of these macrophages during arthritis. We find that dynamic membrane-like structures, consisting of a distinct population of CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident macrophages, form an internal immunological barrier at the synovial lining and physically seclude the joint. These barrier-forming macrophages display features that are otherwise typical of epithelial cells, and maintain their numbers through a pool of locally proliferating CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>-</sup> mononuclear cells that are embedded into the synovial tissue. Unlike recruited monocyte-derived macrophages, which actively contribute to joint inflammation, these epithelial-like CX<sub>3</sub>CR1<sup>+</sup> lining macrophages restrict the inflammatory reaction by providing a tight-junction-mediated shield for intra-articular structures. Our data reveal an unexpected functional diversification among synovial macrophages and have important implications for the general role of macrophages in health and disease.</AbstractText> "

For the treatment of RA, biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) have been used to reduce inflammation and to interfere with disease progression through targeting and mediating the immune system. Although the therapeutic effects of bDMARDs in RA patients have been widely reported, whether these drugs also play important roles in T-cell repertoire status is still unclear. We therefore designed the study to identify the role of T-cell repertoire profiles in RA patients with different types of bDMARD treatments. A high-throughput sequencing approach was applied to profile the T-cell receptor beta chain (TCRB) repertoire of circulating T lymphocytes in eight patients given adalimumab (anti-TNF-<i>α</i>) with/without the following use of either rituximab (anti-CD20) or tocilizumab (anti-IL6R). We subsequently analyzed discrepancies in the clonal diversity and CDR3 length distribution as well as usages of the V and J genes of TCRB repertoire and interrogated the association between repertoire diversity and disease activities followed by the treatment of bDMARDs in these RA patients. All groups of patients showed well-controlled DAS28 scores (&lt;2.6) after different treatment regimens of drugs and displayed no significant statistical differences in repertoire diversity, distribution of CDR3 lengths, and usage of V and J genes of TCRB. Nonetheless, a trend between overall TCRB repertoire diversity and disease activity scores in all bDMARD-treated RA patients was observed. Additionally, age was found to be associated with repertoire diversity in RA patients treated with bDMARDs. Through the profiling of the TCR repertoire in RA patients receiving different biologic medications, our study indicated an inverse tendency between TCR repertoire diversity and disease activity after biologic treatment in RA patients.</AbstractText> "

Analyses of scRNA-seq and GWAS data from human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) supported a similar dispersion of pathogenic mechanisms in different cell types. Thus, systems-level approaches to prioritize biomarkers and drugs are needed. Here, we present a prioritization strategy that is based on constructing network models of disease-associated cell types and interactions using scRNA-seq data from our mouse model of arthritis, as well as human RA, which we term multicellular disease models (MCDMs). We find that the network centrality of MCDM cell types correlates with the enrichment of genes harboring genetic variants associated with RA and thus could potentially be used to prioritize cell types and genes for diagnostics and therapeutics. We validated this hypothesis in a large-scale study of patients with 13 different autoimmune, allergic, infectious, malignant, endocrine, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as a therapeutic study of the mouse arthritis model.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Overall, our results support that our strategy has the potential to help prioritize diagnostic and therapeutic targets in human disease.</AbstractText> "

In rheumatoid arthritis research, this has led to the discovery of important candidate genes which offered novel insights into mechanisms and their possible roles in the cure of the disease. In the last years, data generation has outstripped data analysis and while many studies focused on specific aspects of the disease, a global picture of the disease is not yet accomplished. Here, we analyzed and compared a collection of gene expression information from healthy individuals and from patients suffering under different arthritis conditions from published studies containing the following clinical conditions: early and established rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and arthralgia. We show comprehensive overviews of this data collection and give new insights specifically on gene expression in the early stage, into sex-dependent gene expression, and we describe general differences in expression of different biotypes of genes. Many genes that are related to cytoskeleton changes (actin filament related genes) are differently expressed in early rheumatoid arthritis in comparison to healthy subjects; interestingly, eight of these genes reverse their expression ratio significantly between men and women compared early rheumatoid arthritis and healthy subjects. There are some slighter changes between men and woman between the conditions early and established rheumatoid arthritis. Another aspect are miRNAs and other gene biotypes which are not only promising candidates for diagnoses but also change their expression grossly in average at rheumatoid arthritis and arthralgia compared to the healthy condition. With a selection of intersecting genes, we were able to generate simple classification models to distinguish between healthy and rheumatoid arthritis as well as between early rheumatoid arthritis to other arthritides based on gene expression.</AbstractText> "

The overlap of them has rarely been reported.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A 44-year-old man had a history of multi-joint swelling and pain for more than half a year. His laboratory data with double positive for rheumatoid factor and anticitrullinated protein antibodies further supported the diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis. His previous medical history including progressive hearing loss for several years and microhematuria for one year attracted our attention. Renal biopsy showed thin basement membrane nephropathy and lymphocytes infiltration of interstitium. To make a precise diagnosis, targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of an inherited renal disease panel including Alport syndrome genes was performed, which revealed the missense mutation in COL4A5 (c.1351 T &gt; C, p.Cys451Arg). Further in silico analyses predicted that the p. Cys451Arg mutation is functionally &quot;damaging&quot;, so the diagnosis of Alport syndrome was finally proved. The patient has been receiving the treatment of total glucosides of paeony and leflunomide for rheumatoid arthritis, and Cozaar 50 mg for the protection of kidney so far. During the 10-months follow-up, swelling and tenderness of the joints in this patient had been generally relieved, with no obvious improvement in microhematuria and a slight increase in proteinuria.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">we reported an adult man with the coexistence of rheumatoid arthritis and Alport syndrome with the missense mutation in COL4A5 (c.1351 T &gt; C, p.Cys451Arg).

To identify downstream effectors, RNA from healthy control fibroblasts was sequenced after miR-125b knockdown and further validated using qPCR and Western blotting. Fibrosis, apoptosis, and proliferation were assessed by Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining for cleaved caspase 3, and annexin V real-time assay in dermal fibroblasts.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Expression of miR-125b was significantly down-regulated in SSc skin biopsy specimens by 53% (median fold change 0.47 [interquartile range 0.35-0.69]; P &lt; 0.001) and in SSc dermal fibroblasts by 47% (median fold change 0.53 [interquartile range 0.36-0.58]; P &lt; 0.001) compared to healthy control skin biopsy specimens and fibroblasts, respectively (n = 10 samples per group). Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitors trichostatin A and tubastatin A significantly decreased the expression of miR-125b in dermal fibroblasts. MiR-125b knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. RNA-Seq identified BAK1, BMF, and BBC3 as potential targets of miR-125b. Quantitative PCR confirmed that knockdown of miR-125b up-regulated these genes (P &lt; 0.01; n = 12). Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer 1 showed the strongest induction confirmed at the protein level (P &lt; 0.01; n = 10). Consequently, miR-125b knockdown increased apoptosis compared to scrambled control. Accordingly, miR-125b overexpression decreased apoptosis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our findings indicate that miR-125b is down-regulated in SSc skin and primary dermal fibroblasts. MiR-125b down-regulation increases apoptosis and decreases proliferation and α-SMA expression in dermal fibroblasts, indicating that its compensatory, antifibrotic mechanism may be a potential novel therapeutic option.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

We characterized the small RNA cargoes in JDM and control exosomes by RNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. We then incubated isolated exosomes from healthy controls and children with JDM with cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) for 24 h. Fluorescence microscopy was used to confirm that both control and JDM exosomes were taken up by HAEC. RNA was then purified from HAEC that had been incubated with either control or JDM exosomes and sequenced on the Illumina platform. Differential expression of mRNAs from HAEC incubated with control or JDM exosomes was ascertained using standard computational methods.

The average age at onset was 5.9 years. All patients had no signs of eye or skin problems, such as uveitis, rash, folliculitis and dermal abscess. Prior to the recognition of HA20, P1 was diagnosed with SLE, liver fibrosis and hypothyroidism. She also had no oral, genital or perineal ulcers. P2 was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease-related arthritis (IBD-RA). He had a perianal abscess but no oral or genital ulcers. P3, the father of P1 and P2, only had mild oral ulcers, arthralgia, and archosyrinx. P4 was diagnosed with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in two families. WES revealed heterozygous c.559C &gt; T in the TNFAIP3 gene in P1, P2 and P3, while the c.259C &gt; T mutation in the TNFAIP3 gene was identified in P4.

Recently, a new CARD14 -associated phenotype defined as CAPE (CARD14-associated papulosquamous eruption) with clinical features of both psoriasis and pityriasis rubra pilaris was reported. We describe a family carrying a novel heterozygous mutation in CARD14 gene, with childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis requiring an unusual extremely high dose (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab to achieve disease remission.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We describe a large family with three pairs of twins presenting a clinical phenotype characterized by childhood-onset erythrodermic psoriasis; in some family members is also reported psoriatic arthritis. The two probands presented poor clinical response to topic and systemic therapy with antihistamine, steroid, retinoids, cyclosporine and etanercept. After exclusion of the most common genes associated to autoinflammatory diseases (IL36RN, IL1RN, MVK, TNFRSF1A, NLRP3, NLRP12, MEFV, NOD2, PSMB8, PSTPIP1, LPIN2) we approached a new gene search by subjecting to Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis five members of the family. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.446 T &gt; G, leading to the missense amino acid substitution p.L149R) in the exon 4 of the CARD14 gene was identified in all affected members. Increasing dosages (up to 2 mg/kg every 8 weeks) of ustekinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), allowed the complete control of the clinical manifestations, with an evident reduction of circulating Th17 and Th22 CD4+ T cell subsets.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We describe the association of mutations of the CARD14 gene with an erythrodermic psoriasis pedigree, underlying the necessity to investigate CARD14 mutations in childhood-onset psoriasis cases and confirming the presence of CARD14 causative mutations also in erythrodermic psoriasis form, as recently reported. Also in pediatric age, ustekinumab represents a powerful therapeutic option for this rare condition, that is usually refractory to other treatments. In young children, high and frequent dosages allowed a complete control of the clinical manifestations without any severe side effects, with a long-term follow-up.</AbstractText> "

Abnormal T cell function is found in autoimmune arthritis. We present the first known case of autoimmune arthritis associated with a novel GATA3 mutation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Whole exome sequencing of the proband was performed on a clinical basis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from the proband, healthy sibling, and parent. cDNA prepared from RNA was analyzed with polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Intracellular proteins were assessed by immunoblot of PBMC homogenates. GATA3 in vitro activity was measured in HeLa cell cultures expressing a mammalian expression vector containing GATA3 or mutants generated by site-directed mutagenesis. GATA3 transcriptional activity was examined using a luciferase reporter assay system. T helper cell ex vivo function was evaluated by stimulating PBMCs to differentiate into effector T cells along Th0, Th1, Th2, and Th17 lineages, and re-stimulating effector cells to secrete cytokines. Cytokine production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The proband is the first known case of autoimmune arthritis associated with a mutation in GATA3. The proband M401VfsX106 protein is expressed and has a dominant negative function on GATA3 transcriptional activity. The proband PBMCs have markedly increased differentiation along the Th1 and Th17 pathways, with decreased differentiation along the Th2 pathway. Unexpectedly, Th0 cells from the proband express high levels of IFNγ.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our research presents the first known case of autoimmune arthritis associated with a mutation in GATA3. This work expands the phenotypic spectrum of GATA3 mutations. It reveals the novel insight that decreased and altered GATA3 activity coincides with autoimmune arthritis. This work suggests that modulation of GATA3 may be a therapeutic approach for patients with autoimmune arthritis.</AbstractText> "

To identify miRNA dysregulation in SLE, we used miR2Disease and PhenomiR for information about miRNAs exhibiting differential regulation in disease and other biological processes, and HMDD for information about experimentally supported human miRNA-disease association data from genetics, epigenetics, circulating miRNAs, and miRNA-target interactions. This information was incorporated into the miRNA analysis. High-throughput sequencing revealed circulating miRNAs associated with kidney damage in patients with SLE. As the main finding of our in silico analysis of miRNAs differentially expressed in SLE and their interactions with disease-susceptibility genes, post-translational modifications, and transcription factors; we highlight 226 miRNAs associated with genes and processes. Moreover, we highlight that alterations of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-142-5p, and hsa-miR-324-3p are most commonly associated with post-translational modifications. In addition, altered miRNAs that are most frequently associated with susceptibility-related genes are hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-374a-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p, hsa-miR-31-5p, and hsa-miR-1-3p.</AbstractText> "

HLA-B27/human β<sub>2</sub> -microglobulin-transgenic (HLA-B27-transgenic) and wild-type rats from dark agouti, Lewis, and Fischer backgrounds were used. Inter-omic analyses using Cytoscape were employed to identify relevant relationships. PICRUSt was used to predict microbial functions based on known metagenomic profiles.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Inter-omic analysis revealed several gut microbes that were strongly associated with dysregulated cytokines driving inflammatory response pathways, such as interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-23, IL-17, IL-1, interferon-γ (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Many microbes were uniquely associated with inflammation in Lewis or Fischer rats, and one was relevant on both backgrounds. Several microbes that were strongly correlated with immune dysregulation were not differentially abundant in HLA-B27-transgenic compared to wild-type controls. A multi-omic network analysis revealed non-overlapping clusters of microbes in Lewis and Fischer rats that were strongly linked to overlapping dysregulated immune/inflammatory genes. Prevotella, Clostridiales, and Blautia were important in Lewis rats, while Akkermansia muciniphila and members of the Lachnospiraceae family dominated in Fischer rats. Inflammation-associated metabolic pathway perturbation (e.g., butanoate, propanoate, lipopolysaccharide, and steroid biosynthesis) was also predicted from both backgrounds.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Inter-omic and network analysis of gut microbes and the host immune response in experimental SpA provides an unprecedented view of organisms strongly linked to dysregulated IL-23, IL-17, IL-1, IFNγ, and TNF.

The present study aimed to explore differential gene expression in articular cartilage between patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and KBD. Articular cartilages were collected from KBD and RA patients, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by RNA-seq. The signaling pathway and biological process (BP) of the DEGs were identified by enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of DEGs and the key genes of KBD were identified by network analysis with STRING and cytoscape software. We identified 167 immune-related DEGs in articular cartilage samples from KBD patients compared with RA. The up-regulation of MAPK signaling pathway and the down-regulation of signaling pathways such as toll-like receptor, janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription, leukocyte migration, T-cell receptor and chemokine, and antigen processing and presentation were involved in KBD. We identified 137 genes nodes related with immune and mapped the PPI network diagram. BP analysis revealed that immune response, calcium ion homeostasis, blood vessel morphogenesis, inflammatory response, lymphocyte proliferation, and MAPK activation were involved in KBD. In conclusion, gene expression profiling can be used to identify the different mechanism of pathogenesis between KBD and RA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation> "
"101";"31182740";"Oral microbial dysbiosis linked to worsened periodontal condition in rheumatoid arthritis patients.";" <AbstractText>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. Individuals with RA have a higher risk of periodontitis and periodontitis has been linked to RA through the production of enzymes by periodontal pathogens that citrullinate proteins. This linkage is supported by findings that periodontitis is associated with increased RA severity and treatment of periodontitis can improve the symptoms of RA. The possible mechanism for this association is through dysbiosis of the oral microbiota triggered by RA-induced systemic inflammation. We examined the RA status of subjects by measuring the number of tender and swollen joints, anti-citrullinated protein antibody and rheumatoid factor. Periodontal disease status and salivary cytokine levels were measured, and dental plaque analyzed by 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing. RA patients had a higher bacterial load, a more diverse microbiota, an increase in bacterial species associated with periodontal disease, more clinical attachment loss, and increased production of inflammatory mediators including IL-17, IL-2, TNF, and IFN-γ. Furthermore, changes in the oral microbiota were linked to worse RA conditions. Our study provides new insights into the bi-directional relationship between periodontitis and RA and suggest that monitoring the periodontal health of RA patients is particularly important.</AbstractText> "

This pathogen infects a wide variety of salmonid species during freshwater stages, causing significant losses in the aquaculture industry. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) infected with F. psychrophilum, presents as the main external clinical sign ulcerative lesions and necrotic myositis in skeletal muscle. We previously reported the in vitro cytotoxic activity of F. psychrophilum on rainbow trout myoblast, however little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the in vivo pathogenesis in skeletal muscle. In this study, we examined the transcriptomic profiles of skeletal muscle tissue of rainbow trout intraperitoneally challenged with low infection dose of F. psychrophilum. Using high-throughput RNA-seq, we found that 233 transcripts were up-regulated, mostly associated to ubiquitin mediated proteolysis and apoptosis. Conversely, 189 transcripts were down-regulated, associated to skeletal muscle contraction. This molecular signature was consistent with creatine kinase activity in plasma and oxidative damage in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the increased caspase activity suggests as a whole skeletal muscle atrophy induced by F. psychrophilum. This study offers an integrative analysis of the skeletal muscle response to F. psychrophilum infection and reveals unknown aspects of its pathogenesis in rainbow trout.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Transcriptome/genotypes were integrated by expression-quantitative trail loci (eQTL) analysis; tissue-specific genetic causality was assessed by regulatory trait concordance (RTC).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">SLE has a 'susceptibility signature' present in patients in clinical remission, an 'activity signature' linked to genes that regulate immune cell metabolism, protein synthesis and proliferation, and a 'severity signature' best illustrated in active nephritis, enriched in druggable granulocyte and plasmablast/plasma-cell pathways. Patients with SLE have also perturbed mRNA splicing enriched in immune system and interferon signalling genes. A novel transcriptome index distinguished active versus inactive disease-but not low disease activity-and correlated with disease severity. DEGs discriminate SLE versus healthy individuals with median sensitivity 86% and specificity 92% suggesting a potential use in diagnostics. Combined eQTL analysis from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and SLE-associated genetic polymorphisms demonstrates that susceptibility variants may regulate gene expression in the blood but also in other tissues.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Specific gene networks confer susceptibility to SLE, activity and severity, and may facilitate personalised care.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We have also shown SLE BMSC produce increased amounts of interferon beta (IFNβ), have increased mRNA for several genes induced by IFNβ, and have a pro-inflammatory feedback loop mediated by a MAVS. To better understand the phenotype of SLE BMSC we conducted mRNA sequencing.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Patients fulfilling SLE classification criteria and age and sex matched healthy controls were recruited under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol.

Serum samples were assayed for IFNβ by ELISA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">On the basis of top differentially expressed genes between SLE and healthy controls, SLE patients with high levels of serum IFNβ clustered together while SLE patients with low levels of IFNβ clustered with healthy controls. Those genes differentially expressed in SLE patients generally belonged to known IFN pathways, and showed a strong overlap with the set of genes differentially expressed in IFNβ high subjects, per se. Moreover, gene expression changes induced by treating healthy BMSC with exogenous IFNβ were remarkably similar to gene expression differences in SLE IFNβ high vs low BMSC.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">BMSCs from SLE patients are heterogeneous. A subgroup of SLE BMSC is distinguished from other SLE BMSC and from controls by increased levels of mRNAs induced by type I interferons.

We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to renal biopsies from patients with LN and evaluated skin biopsies as a potential source of diagnostic and prognostic markers of renal disease. Type I interferon (IFN)-response signatures in tubular cells and keratinocytes distinguished patients with LN from healthy control subjects. Moreover, a high IFN-response signature and fibrotic signature in tubular cells were each associated with failure to respond to treatment. Analysis of tubular cells from patients with proliferative, membranous and mixed LN indicated pathways relevant to inflammation and fibrosis, which offer insight into their histologic differences. In summary, we applied scRNA-seq to LN to deconstruct its heterogeneity and identify novel targets for personalized approaches to therapy.</AbstractText> "

It is thought that many common variant gene loci of weak effect act additively to predispose to common autoimmune diseases, while the contribution of rare variants remains unclear. Here we describe that rare coding variants in lupus-risk genes are present in most SLE patients and healthy controls. We demonstrate the functional consequences of rare and low frequency missense variants in the interacting proteins BLK and BANK1, which are present alone, or in combination, in a substantial proportion of lupus patients. The rare variants found in patients, but not those found exclusively in controls, impair suppression of IRF5 and type-I IFN in human B cell lines and increase pathogenic lymphocytes in lupus-prone mice. Thus, rare gene variants are common in SLE and likely contribute to genetic risk.</AbstractText> "

Epigenomic analysis revealed persistent H3K27 acetylation and increased chromatin accessibility in regulatory elements associated with FSGs in TNF-stimulated FLS. The accessible regulatory elements of FSGs were enriched in binding motifs for nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). Inhibition of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) proteins, which interact with histone acetylation, suppressed sustained induction of FSGs by TNF.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our genome-wide analysis has identified the escape of genes from transcriptional repression in FLS as a novel mechanism potentially contributing to the chronic unremitting synovitis observed in RA.

It usually leads to end-stage renal failure at fiftieth decades. Here, we report a 3-year-old Chinese boy in an ADTKD family caused by a novel UMOD gene mutation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"">A 3-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital because of persistent hematuria. Urinalysis showed BLD 2+ without proteinuria. The serum levels of uric acid, creatinine and electrolytes were normal. No renal cyst or calculus was found by ultrasonography. Renal biopsy was performed and focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis was found in 4 glomeruli among 35 glomeruli examined. His father was found with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at the age of 29, and renal ultrasound showed several cysts in both kidneys. A novel heterozygous mutation (c.1648G &gt; A,p.V550I) in exon 8 of UMOD gene was identified by whole exome sequencing in the family. SCBC Genome Browser alignment showed that V550 were highly conserved in uromodulin among different species. Software predicted that the mutation is suspected to be harmful. By literature review, there are 12 mutations of UMOD gene in 14 Chinese families including only one pediatric case(a 16-year-old girl).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">A novel heterozygous mutation (c.1648G &gt; A,p.V550I) in exon 8 of UMOD gene was found in in a Chinese child case with ADTKD-UMOD, which extends our understanding of UMOD gene mutation spectrum and phenotype of ADTKD-UMOD in children.</AbstractText> "

It is also known that under inflammatory stimuli or in the appropriate experimental conditions, they can also act as regulators of inflammation. Thus, in addition to their regenerating potential, their interest has been extended to their possible use in cell therapy strategies for treatment of immune disorders.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">To analyze, by RNA-seq analysis, the transcriptome profiling of allogenic MSCs under RA lymphocyte activation.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We identified the differentially expressed genes in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells after exposure to an inflammatory environment.

This study aimed to evaluate whether a strontium compound (in the form of strontium gluconate, Glu-Sr) could reduce OA pathology severity in osteoarthritic rat models by directly targeting chondrocytes, including catabolic/anabolic activities and/or chondrogenic differentiation. Glu-Sr was administered to OA rats by oral gavage beginning during OA induction and continuing for 8 weeks. Glu-Sr treatment was found to significantly reduce cartilage degeneration and delay OA progression. Further examination showed that collagen II, Sox9, and aggrecan (ACAN) genes were up-regulated whereas IL-1β was down-regulated in chondrocytes isolated from Glu-Sr-treated rats. Glu-Sr also antagonized the catabolic effects of IL-1β on chondrocytes. Furthermore, Glu-Sr was shown to promote the chondrogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), possibly through promoting chondrogenic gene expression, including CTGF and FGF1, as revealed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). These results suggest that systemic administration of Glu-Sr may be useful in prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of chronic cartilage degradation through affecting multiple steps from chondrogenic differentiation of progenitors to matrix formation in mature chondrocytes.</AbstractText> "
"113";"31052237";"Global Responses of Il-1β-Primed 3D Tendon Constructs to Treatment with Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields.";" <AbstractText>Tendinopathy is accompanied by a cascade of inflammatory events promoting tendon degeneration. Among various cytokines, interleukin-1β plays a central role in driving catabolic processes, ultimately resulting in the activation of matrix metalloproteinases and a diminished collagen synthesis, both of which promote tendon extracellular matrix degradation. Pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy is often used for pain management, osteoarthritis, and delayed wound healing. In vitro PEMF treatment of tendon-derived cells was shown to modulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially limiting their catabolic effects. However, our understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remains limited. We therefore investigated the transcriptome-wide responses of Il-1β-primed rat Achilles tendon cell-derived 3D tendon-like constructs to high-energy PEMF treatment. RNASeq analysis and gene ontology assignment revealed various biological processes to be affected by PEMF, including extracellular matrix remodeling and negative regulation of apoptosis. Further, we show that members of the cytoprotective Il-6/gp130 family and the Il-1β decoy receptor Il1r2 are positively regulated upon PEMF exposure. In conclusion, our results provide fundamental mechanistic insight into the cellular and molecular mode of action of PEMF on tendon cells and can help to optimize treatment protocols for the non-invasive therapy of tendinopathies.</AbstractText> "
"114";"31022271";"Insights from deconvolution of cell subtype proportions enhance the interpretation of functional genomic data.";" <AbstractText>Cell subtype proportion variability between samples contributes significantly to the variation of functional genomic properties such as gene expression or DNA methylation. Although the impact of the variation of cell subtype composition on measured genomic quantities is recognized, and some innovative tools have been developed for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, most functional genomics studies using samples with mixed cell types still ignore the influence of cell subtype proportion variation, or just deal with it as a nuisance variable to be eliminated. Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data can provide insights into cellular changes associated with phenotypes. We focused on two types of mixed cell populations, human blood and mouse kidney. Cell type prediction is well developed in the former, but not currently in the latter. Estimating the cellular repertoire is easier when a reference dataset from purified samples of all cell types in the tissue is available, as is the case for blood. However, reference datasets are not available for most other tissues, such as the kidney. In this study, we showed that the proportion of alterations attributable to changes in the cellular composition varies strikingly in the two disorders (asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that the contribution of cell subtype proportion changes to functional genomic properties can be disease-specific. We also showed that a reference dataset from a single-cell RNA-seq study successfully estimated the cell subtype proportions in mouse kidney and allowed us to distinguish altered cell subtype differences between two different knock-out mouse models, both of which had reported a reduced number of glomeruli compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings demonstrate that testing for changes in cell subtype proportions between conditions can yield important insights in functional genomics studies.</AbstractText> "

Various splice variants of <i>POSTN</i> have been described; however, their expression pattern and functional implications are not completely understood. This study was undertaken to decipher the differential expression pattern of <i>POSTN</i> and its splice variants in various tissues and cell types. We show that <i>POSTN</i> was more highly expressed in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) remnants compared with articular cartilage at the cellular and tissue level. Isoforms 1 and 8 were highly expressed only in articular chondrocytes, suggesting their splice-specific regulation in chondrocytes. To discern the role of total <i>POSTN</i> and full-length human POSTN isoform 1 (<i>hPOSTN-001</i>), we stably transfected human chondrosarcoma 1 (hCh-1) cell line with <i>hPOSTN-001</i> using a pcDNA3.1-hPOSTN-001 construct. RNA-sequencing analysis of hCh-1 cells identified differentially expressed genes with a known role in chondrocyte function and osteoarthritis. Similar expression of a subset of candidate genes was revealed in ACL progenitor cells and chondrocytes as well as in ACL progenitor cells in which <i>POSTN</i> activity was altered by overexpression and by small interfering RNA gene knockdown.

Data mining of our RNA-Seq analysis of CD14<sup>+</sup>monocytes showed enrichment for metabolic and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathways in sarcoidosis. Further investigation revealed that sarcoidosis macrophages and monocytes exhibit higher protein levels for HIF-α isoforms, HIF-1β, and their transcriptional co-activator p300 as well as glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). In situ hybridization of sarcoidosis granulomatous lung tissues showed abundance of HIF-1α in the center of granulomas. The abundance of HIF isoforms was mechanistically linked to elevated IL-1β and IL-17 since targeted down regulation of HIF-1α via short interfering RNA or a HIF-1α inhibitor decreased their production. Pharmacological intervention using chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor, decreased lysosomal associated protein 2 (LAMP2) and HIF-1α levels and modified cytokine production.

The clinical success of IL17A neutralizing biologics in psoriasis has underlined its importance as a drug discovery target. While many studies have focused on the differentiation and trafficking of IL17A producing T-helper 17 cells, less is known about IL17A-initiated signaling events in stromal and parenchymal cells leading to psoriatic phenotypes. We sought to discover signaling nodes downstream of IL17A contributing to disease pathogenesis. Using IL17A and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) to stimulate primary human epidermal keratinocytes, we employed two different phenotypic screening approaches. First, a library of ∼22000 annotated compounds was screened for reduced secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL8. Second, a library of 729 kinases was screened in a pooled format by utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 and monitoring IL8 intracellular staining. The highest-ranking novel hits identified in both screens were the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) family proteins and bromodomain-containing protein 2 (BRD2), respectively. Comparison of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 silencing with siRNA and CRISPR confirmed that BRD2 was responsible for mediating IL8 production. Pan-BRD inhibitors and BRD2 knockout also reduced IL17A/TNF-mediated CXC motif chemokines 1/2/6 (CXCL1/2/6) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production. In RNA-Seq analysis, 438 IL17A/TNF dependent genes were reduced in BRD2-deficient primary keratinocytes. KEGG pathway analysis of these genes showed enrichment in TNF signaling and rheumatoid arthritis relevant genes. Moreover, a number of genes important for keratinocyte homeostasis and cornification were dysregulated in BRD2-deficient keratinocytes. In IL17A/TNF/IL22 stimulated three-dimensional organotypic raft cultures, pan-BRD inhibition reduced inflammatory factor production but elicited aberrant cornification, consistent with RNA-Seq analysis. These studies highlight a novel role for BRDs and BRD2 in particular in IL17A-mediated inflammatory signaling.</AbstractText> "

Recent studies showed that the exosomes derived from several types of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could maintain chondrocyte homeostasis and ameliorate the pathological severity of OA in animal models, indicating that MSCs-derived exosomes could be a novel promising strategy for treating OA. In this study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanisms of infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP) MSCs-derived exosomes (MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos) on OA in vitro and in vivo. Our data revealed that MSC<sup>IPFP</sup> could produce amounts of MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos, which exhibited the typical morphological features of exosomes. The MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos ameliorated the OA severity in vivo and inhibited cell apoptosis, enhanced matrix synthesis and reduced the expression of catabolic factor in vitro. Moreover, MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos could significantly enhance autophagy level in chondrocytes partially via mTOR inhibition. Exosomal RNA-seq showed that the level of miR-100-5p that could bind to the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of mTOR was the highest among microRNAs. MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos decreased the luciferase activity of mTOR 3'UTR, while inhibition of miR-100-5p could reverse the MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos-decreased mTOR signaling pathway. Intra-articular injection of antagomir-miR-100-5p dramatically attenuated MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-Exos-mediated protective effect on articular cartilage in vivo. In brief, MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-derived exosomes protect articular cartilage from damage and ameliorate gait abnormality in OA mice by maintaining cartilage homeostasis, the mechanism of which may be related to miR100-5p-regulated inhibition of mTOR-autophagy pathway. As it is relatively feasible to obtain human IPFP from OA patients by arthroscopic operation in clinic, MSC<sup>IPFP</sup>-derived exosomes may be a potential therapy for OA in the future.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Assembly statistics for E. tarda dataset showed that the number of transcript contigs was 9657 out of which 6749 were GO annotated whereas 1528 were not assigned any GO terms. GO analysis showed that the expressed genes were enhanced with molecular function, cellular component and biological process. A KEGG enrichment study showed that pathway's that are directly linked with immune diseases like Rheumatoid arthritis (0.2%), Tuberculosis (0.3%) Endocytosis (0.6%) was considerably enriched. Protein-protein interaction study showed that most of the expressed proteins were involved in metabolic pathways, flagellar assembly, Propanoate metabolism, Microbial metabolism in diverse environments, Butanoate metabolism and Carbon. The present study provides novel E. tarda transcriptome sequence data, allowing us to identify biologically significant genes and their functional relationship with fish diseases, and will be useful in recognize the reliable therapeutic targets in near feature.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is still no efficient cartilage delivery system or novel magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent (CA). Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel class of MR CA, Gd<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>-based nanoparticles (NPs), from a simpler and &quot;greener&quot; approach than previous ones. After the coating of polydopamine (PDA) onto the Gd<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> core, we further anchored a cartilage-targeting peptide and loaded hesperetin (Hes) into NPs (Hes-Gd<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>@PDA-PEG-DWpeptide, HGdPDW), showing excellent cartilage affinity and MR suitability. Additionally, the synthesized HGdPDW exerted significant protective effects against IL-1β stimulation, as shown by the decreased apoptosis and inflammation and increased maturation of chondrocytes in vitro. More importantly, RNA-seq analyses showed the significant reduction of TLR-2 in IL-1β-treated chondrocytes, and this reduction was followed by the inactivation of NF-κB/Akt signaling, leading to the protective effect of HGdPDW. By the establishment of anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) OA mice, the bimodal MRI/IVIS imaging demonstrated the effective cartilage-binding ability of HGdPDW in OA knees with low cytotoxicity, which alleviated the gradual degeneration of articular cartilage in vivo by inhibiting TLR-2 in chondrocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that HGdPDW could target cartilage effectively, thereby protecting chondrocytes from apoptosis and inflammation via TLR-2/NF-κB/Akt signaling. We hope this new class of MRI CA could be applied in not only other fields using MRI technology but also the treatment of general cartilage-related diseases; this application will undoubtedly extend the treatment of OA clinically.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Via RNA Sequencing (RNA-Seq) and mass spectrometry-based protein expression analyses 136 genes and 56 proteins could be identified as being significantly differentially expressed (DE) between the JIAU and POAG group. Gene expression of different immunoglobulin (Ig) components as well as of the B cell-associated factors ID3, ID1, and EBF1 was significantly upregulated in the JIAU group as compared to POAG patients. qRT-PCR analysis showed a significantly higher gene expression of the B cell-related genes CD19, CD20, CD27, CD138, and MZB1 in the JIAU group. At the protein level, a significantly higher expression of Ig components in JIAU than in POAG was confirmed. The B cell-associated protein MZB1 showed a higher expression in JIAU patients than in POAG which was confirmed by western blot analysis. Using bead-based immunoassay analysis we were able to detect a significantly higher concentration of the B cell-activating and survival factors BAFF, APRIL, and IL-6 in the AqH of JIAU and AAU patients than in POAG patients. The intraocularly upregulated B cell-specific genes and proteins in iris tissue suggest that B cells participate in the immunopathology of JIAU. The intracameral environment in JIAU may facilitate local effector and survival functions of B cells, leading to disease course typical for anterior uveitis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, familial cases of systemic-onset JIA have been attributed to mutations in LACC1/FAMIN. We describe three affected siblings from a Moroccan consanguineous family with an early-onset chronic, symmetric and erosive arthritis previously diagnosed as rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarticular JIA. Autozygosity mapping identified four homozygous regions shared by all patients, located in chromosomes 3, 6 (n:2) and 13, containing over 330 genes. Subsequent whole exome sequencing identified two potential candidate variants within these regions (in FARS2 and LACC1/FAMIN). Genotyping of a cohort of healthy Moroccan individuals (n: 352) and bioinformatics analyses finally supported the frameshift c.128_129delGT mutation in the LACC1/FAMIN gene, leading to a truncated protein (p.Cys43Tyrfs*6), as the most probable causative gene defect. Additional targeted sequencing studies performed in patients with systemic-onset JIA (n:23) and RF-negative polyarticular JIA (n: 44) revealed no pathogenic LACC1/FAMIN mutations. Our findings support the homozygous genotype in the LACC1/FAMIN gene as the defect underlying the family here described with a recessively inherited severe inflammatory joint disease. Our evidences provide further support to the involvement of LACC1/FAMIN deficiency in different types of JIA in addition to the initially described systemic-onset JIA.</AbstractText> "

"129";"30864321";"SNPs2ChIP: Latent Factors of ChIP-seq to infer functions of non-coding SNPs.";" <AbstractText>Genetic variations of the human genome are linked to many disease phenotypes. While whole-genome sequencing and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered a number of genotype-phenotype associations, their functional interpretation remains challenging given most single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fall into the non-coding region of the genome. Advances in chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) have made large-scale repositories of epigenetic data available, allowing investigation of coordinated mechanisms of epigenetic markers and transcriptional regulation and their influence on biological function. To address this, we propose SNPs2ChIP, a method to infer biological functions of non-coding variants through unsupervised statistical learning methods applied to publicly-available epigenetic datasets. We systematically characterized latent factors by applying singular value decomposition to ChIP-seq tracks of lymphoblastoid cell lines, and annotated the biological function of each latent factor using the genomic region enrichment analysis tool. Using these annotated latent factors as reference, we developed SNPs2ChIP, a pipeline that takes genomic region(s) as an input, identifies the relevant latent factors with quantitative scores, and returns them along with their inferred functions. As a case study, we focused on systemic lupus erythematosus and demonstrated our method's ability to infer relevant biological function. We systematically applied SNPs2ChIP on publicly available datasets, including known GWAS associations from the GWAS catalogue and ChIP-seq peaks from a previously published study. Our approach to leverage latent patterns across genome-wide epigenetic datasets to infer the biological function will advance understanding of the genetics of human diseases by accelerating the interpretation of non-coding genomes.</AbstractText> "

Among others, these <i>N</i>-linked glycans can affect Ag binding and Ab stability. Elevated <i>N</i>-linked glycosylation has furthermore been associated with several B cell-associated pathologies. Basic knowledge about patterns of V region glycosylation at different stages of B cell development is scarce. The aim of the current study is to establish patterns of <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites in Ab V regions of naive and memory B cell subsets. We analyzed the distribution and acquisition of <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites within Ab V regions of peripheral blood and bone marrow B cells of 12 healthy individuals, eight myasthenia gravis patients, and six systemic lupus erythematosus patients, obtained by next-generation sequencing. <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites are clustered around CDRs and the DE loop for both H and L chains, with similar frequencies for healthy donors and patients. No evidence was found for an overall selection bias against acquiring an <i>N</i>-glycosylation site, except for the CDR3 of the H chain. Interestingly, both IgE and IgG4 subsets have a 2-fold higher propensity to acquire Fab glycans compared with IgG1 or IgA. When expressed as rmAb, 35 out of 38 (92%) nongermline <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites became occupied. These results point toward a differential selection pressure of <i>N</i>-glycosylation site acquisition during affinity maturation of B cells, which depends on the location within the V region and is isotype and subclass dependent.

Despite the identification of more than one hundred genetic variants associated with the disease, not all the cases can be explained. Here, we performed Whole Exome Sequencing in 9 multiplex families (N = 30) to identify rare variants susceptible to play a role in the disease pathogenesis. We pre-selected 77 genes which carried rare variants with a complete segregation with RA in the studied families. Follow-up linkage and association analyses with pVAAST highlighted significant RA association of 43 genes (p-value &lt; 0.05 after 106 permutations) and pinpointed their most likely causal variant. We re-sequenced the 10 most significant likely causal variants (p-value ≤ 3.78*10-3 after 106 permutations) in the extended pedigrees and 9 additional multiplex families (N = 110). Only one SNV in SUPT20H: c.73A&gt;T (p.Lys25*), presented a complete segregation with RA in an extended pedigree with early-onset cases. In summary, we identified in this study a new variant associated with RA in SUPT20H gene. This gene belongs to several biological pathways like macro-autophagy and monocyte/macrophage differentiation, which contribute to RA pathogenesis. In addition, these results showed that analyzing rare variants using a family-based approach is a strategy that allows to identify RA risk loci, even with a small dataset.</AbstractText> "

Cannabinoids acting as dual PPARγ/CB<sub>2</sub> agonists, such as VCE-004.8 and Ajulemic acid (AjA), have been shown to alleviate skin fibrosis and inflammation in SSc models. Since both compounds are being tested in humans, we compared their activities in the bleomycin (BLM) SSc model. Specifically, the pharmacotranscriptomic signature of the compounds was determined by RNA-Seq changes in the skin of BLM mice treated orally with AjA or EHP-101, a lipidic formulation of VCE-004.8. While both compounds down-regulated the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory and fibrotic components of the disease and the pharmacotranscriptomic signatures were similar for both compounds in some pathways, we found key differences between the compounds in vasculogenesis. Additionally, we found 28 specific genes with translation potential by comparing with a list of human scleroderma genes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that both compounds prevented fibrosis, collagen accumulation and Tenascin C (TNC) expression. The endothelial CD31<sup>+</sup>/CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and telocytes were reduced in BLM mice and restored only by EHP-101 treatment. Finally, differences were found in plasmatic biomarker analysis; EHP-101, but not AjA, enhanced the expression of some factors related to angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Altogether the results indicate that dual PPARγ/CB2 agonists qualify as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of SSc and other fibrotic diseases. EHP-101 demonstrated unique mechanisms of action related to the pathophysiology of SSc that could be beneficial in the treatment of this complex disease without current therapeutic options.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

To characterize the key regulators involved in the development of RA, we obtained multilayer epigenomics data including DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, miRNA profiles, genetic variations by whole-exome sequencing, and mRNA profiles from synoviocytes of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. The overall DNA methylation patterns were not much different between RA and OA, but 523 low-methylated regions (LMRs) were specific to RA. The LMRs were preferentially localized at the 5' introns and overlapped with transcription factor binding motifs for GLI1, RUNX2, and TFAP2A/C. Single base-scale differentially methylated CpGs were linked with several networks related to wound response, tissue development, collagen fibril organization, and the TGF-β receptor signaling pathway. Further, the DNA methylation of 201 CpGs was significantly correlated with 27 expressed miRNA genes. Our interpretation of epigenomic data of the synoviocytes from RA and OA patients is an informative resource to further investigate regulatory elements and biomarkers responsible for the pathophysiology of RA and OA.</AbstractText> "

More than half of patients do not carry any pathogenic variant in formerly associated disease genes. Here, we report a cross-sectional study on targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) screening in patients with suspected sAIDs to determine the diagnostic utility of genetic screening. Fifteen autoinflammation/immune-related genes (ADA2-CARD14-IL10RA-LPIN2-MEFV-MVK-NLRC4-NLRP12-NLRP3-NOD2-PLCG2-PSTPIP1-SLC29A3-TMEM173-TNFRSF1A) were used to screen 196 subjects from adult/pediatric clinics, each with an initial clinical suspicion of one or more sAID diagnosis with the exclusion of typical familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) patients. Following the genetic screening, 140 patients (71.4%) were clinically followed-up and re-evaluated. Fifty rare variants in 41 patients (20.9%) were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 32 of those variants were located on the MEFV gene. We detected pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants compatible with the final diagnoses and inheritance patterns in 14/140 (10%) of patients for the following sAIDs: familial Mediterranean fever (n = 7), deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (n = 2), mevalonate kinase deficiency (n = 2), Muckle-Wells syndrome (n = 1), Majeed syndrome (n = 1), and STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (n = 1). Targeted NGS panels have impact on diagnosing rare monogenic sAIDs for a group of patients. We suggest that MEFV gene screening should be first-tier genetic testing especially in regions with high carrier rates. Clinical utility of multi-gene testing in sAIDs was as low as expected, but extensive genome-wide familial analyses in combination with exome screening would enlighten additional genetic factors causing disease.</AbstractText> "

Nampt-deficient mice presented with suppressed inflammatory bone destruction and disease progression in a CIA mouse model. Nampt expression was required for the epigenetic regulation of the Nfatc1 promoter and osteoclastogenesis. Finally, RNA-seq identified 690 differentially expressed genes in whole ankle joints which associated (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) with Nampt expression and CIA.

However, the underlying mechanisms of how they work remain unaddressed. Here, we used RNA-set to profile spleen gene expression in adult mice after consistent intraperitoneal injection of dexamethasone. We identified 13565 genes in control (injected with 0.9% NaCl) and 13702 genes in dexamethasone-injected group, 12920 genes were expressed in both, but 645 genes were identified only in control and 782 genes were identified only in the dexamethasone group. In the dexamethasone-injected group 101 and 67 genes were down-and up-regulated, respectively. Among these, 129 were coding genes, 19 were identified as non-coding genes or pseudogenes, and the remaining 20 were TEC (to be experimentally confirmed) genes. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway was highly enriched in these differentially expressed genes, and that a majority of the 129 identified coding genes were involved in immune system and cell adhesion-associated processes. Moreover, systemic lupus erythematosus, renin-angiotensin system, fat digestion and absorption, and glycerolipid metabolism pathways were significantly affected in the dexamethasone-treatment group. No obvious signaling pathway was enriched in the control group. Additionally, 20 immunoglobulin heavy or light chain variable region genes (IGH(L)Vs) were down regulated in the dexamethasone-injected group. IGH(L)Vs encode the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chain and determine the diversity and specificity of antibodies. We were unable to determine the function of the 19 non-coding genes with differential expression following dexamethasone treatment. Our findings indicate that the expression of IGH(L)Vs and non-coding genes play an important role in the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of dexamethasone and could be developed as potential agents in clinical practice.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Bioinformatic analysis identified RA-specific gene networks and rhythmic processes differing between healthy and RA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">RA caused greater time-of-day variation in PBML gene expression, and ex vivo stimulation identified a time-of-day-specific RA transcriptome. We found increased phospho-STAT3 in RA patients, and some targets, including phospho-ATF2, acquired time-of-day variation in RA. Serum ceramides also gained circadian rhythmicity in RA, which was also seen in mouse experimental arthritis, resulting from gain in circadian rhythmicity of hepatic ceramide synthases.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">RA drives a gain in circadian rhythmicity, both in immune cells, and systemically. The coupling of distant timing information to ceramide synthesis and joint inflammation points to a systemic re-wiring of the circadian repertoire. Circadian reprogramming in response to chronic inflammation has implications for inflammatory co-morbidities and time-of-day therapeutics.</AbstractText> "

While echocardiography is the most important imaging modality for coronary artery assessment, a specific diagnostic biomarker complementary for CAA has not been reported. We aimed to analyze the profiles of exosomal miRNAs extracted from the serum of KD patients and controls to identify candidate biomarkers for CAA. Serum samples from 39 healthy children, 42 CAA patients, 38 coronary artery dilatation (CAD) patients and 45 virus-infected patients including 24 EBV patients and 21 ADV patients were randomly selected. Next generation sequencing was used to analyze serum exosomal miRNA to detect differentially expressed miRNAs. Biomarker candidates were validated by qRT-PCR. One hundred (and) ninety-six differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were detected in CAA patients and healthy children. There were 70 DEMs and 140 DEMs in CAA patients versus CAD patients, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, respectively. We selected the three most upregulated (let-7i-3p, miR-17-3p, and miR-210-5p) and the three most downregulated miRNAs (miR-6743-5p, miR-1246, and miR-6834-5p) in the DEMs, which were expressed differentially in CAA patients versus healthy children, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, not in virus-infected patients versus healthy children, as biomarker candidates. Excluded DEMs of CAD and virus-infected patients, let-7i-3p was detected by sequence data analysis as a biomarker candidate for CAA patients, and then validated by qRT-PCR in a larger set of clinical samples. As a biomarker candidate, let-7i-3p provides an additional means of diagnosing CAA patients. Additionally, miRNA biomarkers complement ultrasonic imaging, allowing for greater diagnostic precision. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "

The mode of inheritance of the genetic risk beyond familial SLE cases is currently unknown. Additionally, the contribution of heterozygous variants in genes known to cause monogenic SLE is not fully understood. Whole-genome sequencing of DNA samples from 71 Swedish patients with SLE and their healthy biological parents was performed to investigate the general genetic risk of SLE using known SLE GWAS risk loci identified using the ImmunoChip, variants in genes associated to monogenic SLE, and the mode of inheritance of SLE risk alleles in these families. A random forest model for predicting genetic risk for SLE showed that the SLE risk variants were mainly inherited from one of the parents. In the 71 patients, we detected a significant enrichment of ultra-rare ( ≤ 0.1%) missense and nonsense mutations in 22 genes known to cause monogenic forms of SLE. We identified one previously reported homozygous nonsense mutation in the C1QC (Complement C1q C Chain) gene, which explains the immunodeficiency and severe SLE phenotype of that patient. We also identified seven ultra-rare, coding heterozygous variants in five genes (C1S, DNASE1L3, DNASE1, IFIH1, and RNASEH2A) involved in monogenic SLE. Our findings indicate a complex contribution to the overall genetic risk of SLE by rare variants in genes associated with monogenic forms of SLE. The rare variants were inherited from the other parent than the one who passed on the more common risk variants leading to an increased genetic burden for SLE in the child. Higher frequency SLE risk variants are mostly passed from one of the parents to the offspring affected with SLE. In contrast, the other parent, in seven cases, contributed heterozygous rare variants in genes associated with monogenic forms of SLE, suggesting a larger impact of rare variants in SLE than hitherto reported.</AbstractText> "

To understand the relationship between host interleukin (IL)-23 signalling and gut bacterial dysbiosis in SpA, we inhibited IL-23 in dysbiotic ZAP-70-mutant SKG mice that develop IL-23-dependent SpA-like arthritis, psoriasis-like skin inflammation and Crohn's-like ileitis in response to microbial beta 1,3-glucan (curdlan).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We treated SKG mice weekly with anti-IL-23 or isotype mAb for 3 weeks, rested them for 3 weeks, then administered curdlan or saline. We collected faecal samples longitudinally, assessed arthritis, spondylitis, psoriasis and ileitis histologically, and analysed the microbiota community profiles using next-generation sequencing. We used multivariate sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis to identify operational taxonomic unit (OTU) signatures best classifying treatment groups and linear regression to develop a predictive model of disease severity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">IL-23p19 inhibition in naïve SKG mice decreased Bacteroidaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Prevotellaceae.

"147";"30670047";"LRRK2 is involved in the pathogenesis of system lupus erythematosus through promoting pathogenic antibody production.";" <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies associated with polyclonal B cell hyperreactivity. Previous study reported that autophagy-related gene Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) was likely a susceptible gene for SLE. However, the pathogenic function of LRRK2 in SLE is undefined.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Using quantitative PCR, we compared the expression levels of LRRK2 in B cells between SLE patients and healthy controls. The expression levels of LRRK2 in in vitro induced CD19<sup>hi</sup> B cells and naïve B cells were compared as well based on RNA-seq assay. A pristane-induced lupus-like mouse model was used to explore the effects of LRRK2 on the development of SLE. IgG level, B cell subsets in the spleens and bone marrows and pathological features in the kidneys were compared between wildtype (WT) and Lrrk2<sup>-/-</sup> littermates.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">It was obvious that LRRK2 expression was dramatically up-regulated in primary B cells from SLE patients compared to those from healthy controls, as well as in activated CD19<sup>hi</sup> B cells. More significantly, LRRK2 expression in B cells was positively correlated with system lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI), an indicator for disease severity, and serum IgG levels in SLE patients. Negative correlations were observed between LRRK2 expression and serum C3 or C4 levels, two clinical features associated with SLE-related nephritis. LRRK2 deficiency reduced the death rate of pristane treated mice. Decreased levels of total IgG and autoantibody were detected in the serum with less deposition of immune complexes and attenuated pathological symptoms in the kidneys of Lrrk2<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Consistent with the reduction in IgG production, the percentages of germinal center B cells and plasma cells decreased significantly as well with LRRK2 deficiency.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study demonstrates that LRRK2 expression is upregulated in B cells from SLE patients with strong correlations to disease severity. LRRK2 deficiency largely attenuates the pathogenic progress of lupus-like features in pristane-induced mice. This is probably achieved through affecting B cell terminal differentiation and subsequent immunoglobulin production.</AbstractText> "

The patient had a central venous catheter (CVC) that had been in place for the previous 6 years for treatment of refractory hypertension and congestive heart failure. Blood cultures obtained from the CVC on initial presentation were positive for a mixed infection, which was subcultured and grew <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i>, <i>Acinetobacter radioresistens</i> and <i>Leifsonia aquatica</i> based on the Becton Dickinson Phoenix Automated Microbiology System. The <i>L. aquatica</i>, designated as isolate 4120, was further analysed, since infections associated with this organism are uncommon, and it was the only organism to grow from the patient's catheter tip. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MS identified isolate 4120 as <i>Microbacterium paraoxydans</i>. To resolve the conflicting results, additional analyses of isolate 4120 were carried out and compared to several reference strains.

After transcript alignment, counts were performed using Salmon and differential expression for ENSEMBL lincRNAs determined using DESeq2. Hip RNA-seq lincRNA expression was compared to a knee dataset (ArrayExpress; E-MTAB-4304). ChIP-seq data from ENCODE was used to determine whether lincRNAs were associated with promoters (plncRNA) or unidirectional enhancer-like regulatory elements (elncRNAs).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Our analysis of the hip transcriptome identified 1692 expressed Transcripts Per Million (TPM ≥1) Ensembl lincRNAs, of which 198 were significantly (FDR ≤0.05) differentially expressed in OA vs normal (NOF) cartilage. Similar analysis of knee cartilage transcriptome identified 648 Emsembl lincRNAs with 93 significantly (FDR ≤0.05) differentially expressed in intact vs damaged cartilage. In total, 1834 lincRNAs were expressed in both hip and knee cartilage, with a highly significant correlation in expression between the two cartilages.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This is the first study to use RNA-seq to map and compare the lincRNA transcriptomes of hip and knee cartilage.

Moreover, we validated the direct and transcriptional regulatory effect of NovelmiRNA-25 on adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (AMPD2) using a dual-luciferase reporter assay and western blot and confirmed AMPD2 mRNA and protein expression in PBMCs using qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Multilayer integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA regulation showed that 10 miRNAs were down-regulated and 19 miRNAs were up-regulated in SLE patient PBMCs compared with HCs. Bioinformatics analysis of regulatory networks between miRNAs and mRNAs showed that 19 miRNAs were related to metabolic processes. Two candidate miRNAs, NovelmiRNA-25 and miR-1273h-5p, which were significantly increased in the PBMCs of SLE patients (P &lt; 0.05), represented diagnostic biomarkers with sensitivities of 94.74% and 89.47%, respectively (area under the curve = 0.574 and 0.788, respectively). NovelmiRNA-25 expression in PBMCs was associated with disease activity in SLE patients, in both active and stable groups (P &lt; 0.05). NovelmiRNA-25 overexpression downregulated AMPD2 expression in HEK293T cells through direct targeting of the AMPD2 3'UTR (P &lt; 0.01), while inhibition of NovelmiRNA-25 activity led to increased AMPD2 expression (P &lt; 0.01). NovelmiRNA-25 overexpression also downregulated AMPD2 protein expression in HEK293T cells; AMPD2 protein expression in SLE patient PBMCs was decreased. Our results show that differentially expressed miRNAs play an important role in SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our data demonstrate a novel mechanism in SLE development that involves the targeting of AMPD2 expression by NovelmiRNA-25. miRNAs may serve as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and evaluation of disease activity of SLE and represent potential therapeutic targets for this disease.</AbstractText> "

Structural changes with nerve ingrowth and vascular penetration within OA cartilage may contribute to arthritic joint pain. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes and potential miRNA regulations in OA knee chondrocytes through next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Results suggested the involvement of SMAD family member 3 (<i>SMAD3</i>) and Wnt family member 5A (<i>WNT5A</i>) in the growth of blood vessels and cell aggregation, representing features of cartilage damage in OA. Additionally, 26 dysregulated genes with potential miRNA⁻mRNA interactions were identified in OA knee chondrocytes. Myristoylated alanine rich protein kinase C substrate (<i>MARCKS</i>), epiregulin (<i>EREG</i>), leucine rich repeat containing 15 (<i>LRRC15</i>), and phosphodiesterase 3A (<i>PDE3A</i>) expression patterns were similar among related OA cartilage, subchondral bone and synovial tissue arrays in Gene Expression Omnibus database. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified <i>MARCKS</i> to be associated with the outgrowth of neurite, and novel miRNA regulations were proposed to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of the altered OA knee joint microenvironment.

Our previous study has shown that salvianolic acid B (SAB), a bioactive component extracted from Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM), was one of the essential ingredients in the traditional Chinese medicine Yiqihuoxue formula, which has been used to treat SSc-related dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of SAB on skin fibrosis and explore its underlying anti-fibrotic mechanism. We found that SAB was capable of alleviating skin fibrosis in a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model, alleviating skin thickness and reducing collagen deposition. in vitro studies indicated that SAB reduced SSc skin fibroblast proliferation and downregulated extracellular matrix gene transcription and collagen protein expression. TGF-β/SMAD and MAPK/ERK pathway activation were also shown to be suppressed in SAB treated fibroblasts. Moreover, RNA-seq revealed that the anti-fibrotic effect of SAB might be related to antioxidant activity, the cell cycle, and the p53 signaling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest that SAB has the ability to alleviate SSc-related skin fibrosis both in vivo and in vitro.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

We conducted the first integrative analysis of the fibrotic programming in these cells at the levels of gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression, as well as deposited ECM protein to gain insights into how fibrotic transcriptional programs culminate in aberrant ECM protein production/deposition. We identified messenger RNA (mRNA), miRNA, and deposited matrisome protein signatures for IPF and SSc fibroblasts obtained from lung transplants using next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry. SSc and IPF fibroblast transcriptional signatures were remarkably similar, with enrichment of WNT, TGF-β, and ECM genes. miRNA-seq identified differentially regulated miRNAs, including downregulation of miR-29b-3p, miR-138-5p and miR-146b-5p in disease fibroblasts and transfection of their mimics decreased expression of distinct sets of fibrotic signature genes as assessed using a Nanostring fibrosis panel. Finally, proteomic analyses uncovered a distinct &quot;fibrotic&quot; matrisome profile deposited by IPF and SSc fibroblasts compared to controls that highlights the dysregulated ECM production underlying their fibrogenic activities. Our comprehensive analyses of mRNA, miRNA, and matrisome proteomic profiles in IPF and SSc lung fibroblasts revealed robust fibrotic signatures at both the gene and protein expression levels and identified novel fibrogenesis-associated miRNAs whose aberrant downregulation in disease fibroblasts likely contributes to their fibrotic and ECM gene expression.</AbstractText> "

However, these findings were based on the identification of culturable bacteria and at times not below burial grounds. Investigation on the bacterial diversity and functional profiles of bacterial communities above and below burial grounds in human cemeteries are few. The current study used high-throughput sequencing techniques to determine the bacterial composition and their associated functional profiles in cemetery soil samples collected at the surface and below burial ground in two South African cemeteries (Maitland Cemetery in Cape Town and Fontein Street Cemetery in Middelburg) to evaluate the potential health threat to surrounding populations through contamination of groundwater. Significant differences were observed between sample depths with the clustering of the surface (0 m) and the 2 m samples into separate groups. Pseudomonas and Corynebacterium were the most abundant genera across all samples. Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus were the dominant genera in the 2 m samples while Prauserella and Staphylococcus were dominant in the surface samples. The 2 m samples showed a lower alpha diversity but recorded higher proportions of human diseases functional classes compared to the surface samples. Human disease functional profiles revealed involvement, in infectious (cholera), neurodegenerative (Alzheimer's disease) cardiovascular (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) immune system (Systemic lupus erythematosus) metabolic (Type I &amp; II diabetes) diseases and cancer. Antibiotic resistance and antibiotics synthesis signatures were also identified. Thus, cemeteries could be potential sources of microbial and antibiotic pollution in groundwater, especially in areas with shallow water tables such as Maitland. Selection of sites for use as cemeteries should, therefore, require a proper understanding of the hydrogeological characteristics of the selected site. However, further studies are required to trace the actual movement of these pollutants into groundwater resources.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

No changes were detected in the other canonical opioid receptor genes: OPRK1, OPRD1, and OPRM1. Nociceptin reportedly increases the sensation of pain in supra-spinal pain transduction pathways. Thus, CC and CC-BS may downregulate OPRL1, consequently inhibiting production of the nociception receptor NOP, leading to pain relief. In neuroglia cells, CC and CC-BS inhibited signaling pathways related to opioids, neuropathic pain, neuroinflammation, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid diseases. CC and CC-BS also downregulated ADAM metallopeptidase gene ADAMTS5 expression by 11.2-fold and 13.5-fold, respectively. ADAMTS5 encodes a peptidase that plays a crucial role in osteoarthritis development via inhibition of a corresponding signaling pathway.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Here, we report for the first time that CC and CC-BS act as nociceptin receptor antagonists, selectively downregulating opioid-related nociceptin receptor 1 gene (OPRL1) expression, which is associated with pain relief. BS alone did not affect OPRL1 expression, but rather appears to potentiate the effects of CC via multiple mechanisms, including synergistic interactions of molecular networks.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

The latter further adds the value for compatibility with low input samples, optical imaging, scalability, and portability. However, cell lysis in microwells remains challenging despite the recently developed sophisticated solutions. Here, we present scFTD-seq, a microchip platform for performing single-cell freeze-thaw lysis directly toward 3' mRNA sequencing. It offers format flexibility with a simplified, widely adoptable workflow that reduces the number of preparation steps and hands-on time, with the quality of data and cost per sample matching that of the state-of-the-art scRNA-seq platforms. Freeze-thaw, known as an unfavorable lysis method resulting in possible RNA fragmentation, turns out to be fully compatible with 3' scRNA-seq. We applied it to the profiling of circulating follicular helper T cells implicated in systemic lupus erythematosus pathogenesis. Our results delineate the heterogeneity in the transcriptional programs and effector functions of these rare pathogenic T cells. As scFTD-seq decouples on-chip cell isolation and library preparation, we envision it to allow sampling at the distributed sites including point-of-care settings and downstream processing at centralized facilities, which should enable wide-spread adoption beyond academic laboratories.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2018.

To support the results of genetic mapping studies for CHD and its concomitant osteoarthritis with functional information, we performed RNA-seq on hip capsule and teres ligament of affected and unaffected dogs. RNA seq showed that expressed genes segregated according age, capsule or ligament, and hip phenotype. Expression of HHIP, DACT2, and WIF1 was significantly higher in capsule from control hips than dysplastic hips indicating a disruption of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Expression of SPON 1, a key component of the WNT pathway, was increased significantly in both dysplastic capsule and ligament while FBN2 and EMILIN3 were significantly increased in dysplastic capsule. Of genes associated with human hip osteoarthritis, expression of ACAN, IGF1, CILP2, COL11A1, COL8A1, and HAPLN was increased significantly in dysplastic capsule. The significant increase in expression of PLA2F, TNFRSF, TMEM, and IGFBP in dysplastic capsule indicated an injury response. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that genes involved in extracellular matrix structure, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, myogenesis, growth factor signaling, cancer and immune pathways were enriched in dysplastic capsule. For teres ligament from dysplastic joints, genes in retinoic signaling pathways and those encoding extracellular matrix molecules, but not proteoglycans, were enriched. Hip tissues respond to abnormal mechanics early in dysplastic hip development and these pathways present targets for intervention in the early synovitis and capsulitis secondary to canine and human hip dysplasia. © 2018 Orthopaedic Research Society.

With technological advances, pharmacogenomic research has evolved from candidate gene analyses to genome-wide association studies. Here, we integrate deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) information with drug prescription and ADE data from Estonian electronic health record (EHR) databases to evaluate genome- and pharmacome-wide associations on an unprecedented scale. We leveraged WGS data of 2240 Estonian Biobank participants and imputed all single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with allele counts over 2 for 13,986 genotyped participants. Overall, we identified 41 (10 novel) loss-of-function and 567 (134 novel) missense variants in 64 very important pharmacogenes. The majority of the detected variants were very rare with frequencies below 0.05%, and 6 of the novel loss-of-function and 99 of the missense variants were only detected as single alleles (allele count = 1). We also validated documented pharmacogenetic associations and detected new independent variants in known gene-drug pairs. Specifically, we found that CTNNA3 was associated with myositis and myopathies among individuals taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory oxicams and replicated this finding in an extended cohort of 706 individuals. These findings illustrate that population-based WGS-coupled EHRs are a useful tool for biomarker discovery.</AbstractText> "

Furthermore, CD5+ B cells contain important subsets: IL-10-producing B-reg cells, FasL-expressing subset, and the majority of pre-naive B cells. In addition, they are major sources of natural autoantibodies, which are polyreactive and autoreactive. Thus, CD5+ B cells are clearly loaded with autoimmune clues that are yet to be unlocked and understood. We hypothesize that human CD5+ B cells are likely to yield enormously important novel information about the role of B cells in autoimmune disease if analyzed using the new technological advances in molecular biology and genomics. Use of high-throughput sequencing of B cell receptors (BCR) of CD5+ B cells could reveal public BCRs associated with autoimmune diseases, whereas transcriptional analysis of CD5+ B cells using single-cell RNA-seq may delineate distinct sublineages and their relationship to conventional B cells. If it turns out that autoimmune repertoires are concentrated in CD5+ B cells, given that CD5+ B cells are clearly identifiable by flow cytometry, therapeutic strategies can be developed to safely remove CD5+ B cells to mitigate ongoing autoimmunity and protect at-risk individuals.</AbstractText> "

While genetic and transcriptomic analyses have revealed some genes and non-coding loci associated to OA, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Chromatin profiling, which provides insight into gene regulation, has not been reported in OA mainly due to technical difficulties. Here, we employed Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map the accessible chromatin landscape in articular knee cartilage of OA patients. We identified 109,215 accessible chromatin regions for cartilages, of which 71% were annotated as enhancers. By overlaying them with genetic and DNA methylation data, we have determined potential OA-relevant enhancers and their putative target genes. Furthermore, through integration with RNA-seq data, we characterized genes that are altered both at epigenomic and transcriptomic levels in OA. These genes are enriched in pathways regulating ossification and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Consistently, the differentially accessible regions in OA are enriched for MSC-specific enhancers and motifs of transcription factor families involved in osteoblast differentiation. In conclusion, we demonstrate how direct chromatin profiling of clinical tissues can provide comprehensive epigenetic information for a disease and suggest candidate genes and enhancers of translational potential.</AbstractText> "

Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), our goal was to identify EC markers and signature pathways associated with vascular injury in SSc skin. <b>Methods:</b> We implemented single cell sorting and subsequent RNA sequencing of cells isolated from SSc and healthy control skin. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to identify the various cell types. We performed pathway analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Finally, we independently verified distinct markers using immunohistochemistry on skin biopsies and qPCR in primary ECs from SSc and healthy skin. <b>Results:</b> By combining the t-SNE analysis with the expression of known EC markers, we positively identified ECs among the sorted cells. Subsequently, we examined the differential expression profile between the ECs from healthy and SSc skin. Using GSEA and IPA analysis, we demonstrated that the SSc endothelial cell expression profile is enriched in processes associated with extracellular matrix generation, negative regulation of angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Two of the top differentially expressed genes, <i>HSPG2</i> and <i>APLNR</i>, were independently verified using immunohistochemistry staining and real-time qPCR analysis. <b>Conclusion:</b> ScRNA-seq, differential gene expression and pathway analysis revealed that ECs from SSc patients show a discrete pattern of gene expression associated with vascular injury and activation, extracellular matrix generation and negative regulation of angiogenesis. HSPG2 and APLNR were identified as two of the top markers of EC injury in SSc.</AbstractText> "

We conducted whole-genome sequencing on multiplex Japanese families with atypical psychosis. The patient group of interest shows acute psychotic features including hallucinations, delusions, and catatonic symptoms while they often show good prognosis after the onset. In addition to the next-generation analysis, HLA typing has been conveyed to check the similarity with autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Shared causal polymorphisms in the Deleted in Colorectal Carcinoma, Netrin 1 receptor (DCC) gene were found in one multiplex family with three patients, and variants in the RNA 3'-Terminal Phosphate Cyclase (RTCA) and One Cut Homeobox 2 (ONECUT2) genes were found to be shared in seven patients. Next-generation sequencing analysis of the MHC region (previously suggested to be a hot region in atypical psychosis) using HLA typing (HLA-DRB1) revealed a common vulnerability with SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) among five patients. This finding demonstrates the shared etiology between psychotic symptoms and autoimmune diseases at the genetic level. Focusing on a specific clinical phenotype is key for elucidating the genetic factors that underlie the complex traits of psychosis.</AbstractText> "
"169";"30319641";"Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Is Dependent on Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Signaling.";" <AbstractText>About 40% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus experience diffuse neuropsychiatric manifestations, including impaired cognition and depression. Although the pathogenesis of diffuse neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) is not fully understood, loss of brain barrier integrity, autoreactive antibodies, and pro-inflammatory cytokines are major contributors to disease development. Fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator, prevents lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs through functional antagonism of S1P receptors. In addition to reducing the circulation of autoreactive lymphocytes, fingolimod has direct neuroprotective effects such as preserving brain barrier integrity and decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by astrocytes and microglia. Given these effects, we hypothesized that fingolimod would attenuate neurobehavioral deficits in MRL-lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice, a validated neuropsychiatric lupus model. Fingolimod treatment was initiated after the onset of disease, and mice were assessed for alterations in cognitive function and emotionality. We found that fingolimod significantly attenuated spatial memory deficits and depression-like behavior in MRL/lpr mice. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated a dramatic lessening of brain T cell and macrophage infiltration, and a significant reduction in cortical leakage of serum albumin, in fingolimod treated mice. Astrocytes and endothelial cells from treated mice exhibited reduced expression of inflammatory genes, while microglia showed differential regulation of key immune pathways. Notably, cytokine levels within the cortex and hippocampus were not appreciably decreased with fingolimod despite the improved neurobehavioral profile. Furthermore, despite a reduction in splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and circulating autoantibody titers, IgG deposition within the brain was unaffected by treatment. These findings suggest that fingolimod mediates attenuation of NPSLE through a mechanism that is not dependent on reduction of autoantibodies or cytokines, and highlight modulation of the S1P signaling pathway as a novel therapeutic target in lupus involving the central nervous system.</AbstractText> "

Previous GWAS identified common variants with modest effects on serum urate. Here we report large-scale whole-exome sequencing association studies of serum urate and kidney function among ≤19,517 European ancestry and African-American individuals. We identify aggregate associations of low-frequency damaging variants in the urate transporters SLC22A12 (URAT1; p = 1.3 × 10<sup>-56</sup>) and SLC2A9 (p = 4.5 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Gout risk in rare SLC22A12 variant carriers is halved (OR = 0.5, p = 4.9 × 10<sup>-3</sup>). Selected rare variants in SLC22A12 are validated in transport studies, confirming three as loss-of-function (R325W, R405C, and T467M) and illustrating the therapeutic potential of the new URAT1-blocker lesinurad. In SLC2A9, mapping of rare variants of large effects onto the predicted protein structure reveals new residues that may affect urate binding. These findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of serum urate, and highlight molecular targets in SLC22A12 and SLC2A9 for lowering serum urate and preventing gout.</AbstractText> "

The incidence of AMI in some countries increases year by year, and shows younger trend. Some study indicated that abnormal expression of lncRNAs was closely related to cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to examine the lncRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with AMI through controlled studies.In the present study, we examined the lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in 8 patients with AMI, with 7 NCA (noncoronary artery) subjects as controls using RNA sequencing protocol (RNA-seq) on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The differentially expressed lncRNAs were selected for bioinformatic analysis including gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG). Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to confirm the differential expression of lncRNAs.We kept about 11.29 gigabase (Gb) high-quality sequence data while the Q30 ranged from 94.39% to 95.19% for each sample. Compared to the lncRNA expression profiles of NCA controls, a total of 106 differentially expressed lncRNAs were discriminated in AMI patients, including 40 upregulated lncRNAs and 66 downregulated lncRNAs (P &lt; .05). Among the genes corresponding to the identified mRNAs, 2905 genes are involved in biological processes, 339 in cellular components, and 501 in molecular functions. Based on the KEGG pathway analysis, the most enriched pathways corresponding to the differentially expressed lncRNAs were associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, alcoholism, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease and viral carcinogenesis, and so on. Further, 3 upregulated and 3 downregulated lncRNAs were randomly selected for qRT-PCR verification and the results of qRT-PCR were consistent with the findings obtained from RNA sequencing analysis.As a result, differential expression profiles of lncRNAs in AMI were identified in our study. The results suggested that lncRNAs may play important roles in the biological and pathological processes of AMI. These findings may provide useful reference for the early diagnosis and risk stratification of AMI patients. To enlarge the sample size in the next step will be needed for further research to confirm our results.</AbstractText> "

The study focused on a 67-year-old woman who presented with a 40-year history of familial endometriosis associated with various non-gynecological co-morbidities, thus representing a unique case from a cohort of 1,000 patients with endometriosis. Her family history included infertile members suffering from endometriosis. Thirteen non-gynecological co-morbidities were documented throughout the years, including five autoimmune diseases (i.e., systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, bronchial asthma and Crohn's disease), urinary bladder diverticulum, osteoporosis, multinodular goiter, cardiovascular diseases, gastroesophageal reflux disease, malignant tumor of urinary bladder, Barrett's esophagus and bilateral cataract. In order to understand the potential role of gene mutations in the development of all those co-morbidities, whole exome sequencing was performed and the presence of various disease-associated, potentially causal missense variants, were observed. These findings are in accordance with the previously suggested common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, autoimmune disorders. This unusual case provides novel insights demonstrating that endometriosis can coexist with various chronic autoimmune diseases and other conditions, including non-gynecological malignancies, which possibly share a common genetic cause, a fact that should be taken into consideration seriously by clinicians.</AbstractText> "

Indeed, the 3 siblings all had a marked clinical response and resolution of symptoms with rituximab, although 2 of the siblings had severe reactions to rituximab thus precluding further treatment with this. We therefore describe the first successful use of ofatumumab for this rare form of monogenic SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">All three affected siblings presented with SLE before the age of 3-years with lethargy, intermittent fever, thrombocytopenia, cutaneous involvement, alopecia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Tubulointerstitial nephritis was also present in 1 of the siblings. Homozygosity mapping followed by whole exome sequencing identified a homozygous missense mutation in PRKCD (p.Gly432Trp), subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing to be present in all 3 siblings. All 3 patients were initially treated with rituximab, however 2 of the siblings developed severe infusion-related reactions. For subsequent disease flare in these individuals we therefore used an alternative B cell depleting agent, ofatumumab (300 mg/1.73m<sup>2</sup> on day 1; 700 mg/1.73m<sup>2</sup> on day 15).

Current implant design permits long-term survivorship of THAs, but certain metal-on-metal (MoM) articulations can portend catastrophic failure due to adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR). Here, we identified biological and molecular differences between periacetabular synovial tissues of patients with MoM THA failure undergoing revision THA compared to patients undergoing primary THA for routine osteoarthritis (OA). Analysis of tissue biopsies by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that MoM patient samples exhibit significantly increased expression of immune response genes but decreased expression of genes related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Thus, interplay between local tissue inflammation and ECM degradation may account for the pathology and compromised clinical outcomes in select patients with MoM implants. We conclude that adverse responses of host tissues to implant materials result in transcriptomic modifications in patients with MoM implants that permit consideration of strategies that could mitigate ECM damage.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Diagnosis of KS was established after whole exome sequencing (WES) and detection of de novo frameshift 1bp deletion in histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2D gene (KMT2D). The pathogenic variant in exon 34 (c.8626delC: 55 reads C, 56 reads delC), has not been described previously and is predicted to truncate the protein (p.Gln2876Serfs*34) resulting in KMT2D loss of function. Notwithstanding that patients with KS have a substantial susceptibility to various autoimmune diseases, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of an SLE and KS association. The exact relationship between the two conditions in our patient is difficult to determine with certainty, as a number of clinical features, including positive antiphospholipid antibodies, persistent hypogammaglobulinemia and the episode of convulsions may occur in both conditions, suggesting potential overlap of KS and SLE. The combination of a high susceptibility towards infections and an autoimmune disorder present a great challenge when trying to achieve the optimum therapy which will enable the patient to stay on the thin line of remission.

"179";"30205482";"Comparative Transcriptomics Identifies Novel Genes and Pathways Involved in Post-Traumatic Osteoarthritis Development and Progression.";" <AbstractText>Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries often result in post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). To better understand the molecular mechanisms behind PTOA development following ACL injury, we profiled ACL injury-induced transcriptional changes in knee joints of three mouse strains with varying susceptibility to OA: STR/ort (highly susceptible), C57BL/6J (moderately susceptible) and super-healer MRL/MpJ (not susceptible). Right knee joints of the mice were injured using a non-invasive tibial compression injury model and global gene expression was quantified before and at 1-day, 1-week, and 2-weeks post-injury using RNA-seq. Following injury, injured and uninjured joints of STR/ort and injured C57BL/6J joints displayed significant cartilage degeneration while MRL/MpJ had little cartilage damage. Gene expression analysis suggested that prolonged inflammation and elevated catabolic activity in STR/ort injured joints, compared to the other two strains may be responsible for the severe PTOA phenotype observed in this strain. MRL/MpJ had the lowest expression values for several inflammatory cytokines and catabolic enzymes activated in response to ACL injury. Furthermore, we identified several genes highly expressed in MRL/MpJ compared to the other two strains including <i>B4galnt2</i> and <i>Tpsab1</i> which may contribute to enhanced healing in the MRL/MpJ. Overall, this study has increased our knowledge of early molecular changes associated with PTOA development.</AbstractText> "

We asked whether the profound B cell loss in belimumab-treated SLE patients is accompanied by shifts in the immunoglobulin repertoire. We enrolled 15 patients who had been continuously treated with belimumab for more than 7 years, 17 matched controls, and 5 patients who were studied before and after drug initiation. VH genes of sort-purified mature B cells and plasmablasts were subjected to next-generation sequencing. We found that B cell-activating factor (BAFF) regulates the transitional B cell checkpoint, with conservation of transitional 1 (T1) cells and approximately 90% loss of T3 and naive B cells after chronic belimumab treatment. Class-switched memory B cells, B1 B cells, and plasmablasts were also substantially depleted. Next-generation sequencing revealed no redistribution of VH, DH, or JH family usage and no effect of belimumab on representation of the autoreactive VH4-34 gene or CDR3 composition in unmutated IgM sequences, suggesting a minimal effect on selection of the naive B cell repertoire. Interestingly, a significantly greater loss of VH4-34 was observed among mutated IgM and plasmablast sequences in chronic belimumab-treated subjects than in controls, suggesting that belimumab promotes negative selection of activated autoreactive B cells.</AbstractText> "
"181";"30174216";"Lipocalin-2 is a pathogenic determinant and biomarker of neuropsychiatric lupus.";" <AbstractText>Neuropsychiatric manifestations in lupus (NPSLE) affect ∼20-40% of patients. In the central nervous system, lipocalin-2 (LCN2) can promote injury through mechanisms directly linked to NPSLE, including brain barrier disruption, neurotoxicity, and glial activation. Since LCN2 is elevated in lupus and has been implicated in neuroinflammation, we investigated whether LCN2 is required for the pathogenesis of NPSLE. Here, we investigated the effects of LCN2 deficiency on the development of neurobehavioral deficits in the B6.Sle1.Sle3 (Sle1,3) mouse lupus model. Sle1,3 mice exhibited depression-like behavior and impaired spatial and recognition memory, and these deficits were attenuated in Sle1,3-LCN2KO mice. Whole-brain flow cytometry showed a significant increase in brain infiltrating leukocytes in Sle1,3 mice that was not reduced by LCN2 deficiency. RNA sequencing on sorted microglia revealed that several genes differentially expressed between B6 and Sle1,3 mice were regulated by LCN2, and that these genes are key mediators of the neuroinflammatory cascade. Importantly, LCN2 is upregulated in the cerebrospinal fluid of NPSLE patients across 2 different ethnicities. Our findings establish the Sle1,3 strain as an NPSLE model, demonstrate that LCN2 is a major regulator of the detrimental neuroimmune response in NPSLE, and identify CSF LCN2 as a novel biomarker for NPSLE.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a multifactorial disorder with a significant genetic component. The heritability of OA has been estimated to be 60% for hip OA and 39% for knee OA. Genetic factors behind OA are still largely unknown. Studying families with strong history of OA, facilitates examining the co-segregation of genetic variation and OA. The aim of this study was to identify new, rare genetic factors and novel candidate genes for OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Eight patients from three Finnish families with hip and knee OA were studied using whole exome sequencing. We focused on rare exonic variants with predicted pathogenicity and variants located in active promoter or strong enhancer regions. Expression of identified candidate genes were studied in bone and cartilage tissues and the observed variants were investigated using bioinformatic analyses.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Two rare variants co-segregated with OA in two families. In Family 8 a missense variant (c.628C&gt;G, p.Arg210Gly) was observed in the OLIG3 gene that encodes a transcription factor known to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory polyarthritis. The Arg210Gly variant was estimated to be pathogenic by Polyphen-2 and Mutation taster and the locus is conserved among mammals. In Family 12 the observed variant (c.-127G&gt;T) was located in the transcription start site of the FIP1L1 gene. FIP1L1 participates in the regulation of polyadenylation. The c.-127G&gt;T is located in the transcription start site and may alter the DNA-binding of transcription factors. Both, OLIG3 and FIP1L1 were observed in human bone and cartilage.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The identified variants revealed novel candidate genes for OA. OLIG3 and FIP1L1 have specific roles in transcription and may effect expression of other genes. Identified variants in these genes may thus have a role in the regulatory events leading to OA.</AbstractText> "
"183";"30149120";"Transposable element dysregulation in systemic lupus erythematosus and regulation by histone conformation and Hsp90.";" <AbstractText>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represents an autoimmune disease in which activation of the type I interferon pathway leads to dysregulation of tolerance and the generation of autoantibodies directed against nuclear constituents. The mechanisms driving the activation of the interferon pathway in SLE have been the subject of intense investigation but are still incompletely understood. Transposable elements represent an enormous source of RNA that could potentially stimulate the cell intrinsic RNA-recognition pathway, leading to upregulation of interferons. We used RNA-seq to define transposable element families and subfamilies in three cell types in SLE and found diverse effects on transposable element expression in the three cell types and even within a given family of transposable elements. When potential mechanisms were examined, we found that Hsp90 inhibition could drive increased expression of multiple type of transposable elements. Both direct inhibition and the delivery of a heat shock itself, which redirects heat shock regulators (including Hsp90) off of basal expression promoters and onto heat shock-responsive promoters, led to increased transposable element expression. This effect was amplified by the concurrent delivery of a histone deacetylase inhibitor. We conclude that transposable elements are dysregulated in SLE and there are tissue-specific effects and locus-specific effects. The magnitude of RNAs attributable to transposable elements makes their dysregulation of critical interest in SLE where transposable element RNA complexed with proteins has been shown to drive interferon expression.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

"184";"30143393";"Evidence for a potential role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmune disease risk using integrative bioinformatics.";" <AbstractText>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of genetic risk loci for autoimmune diseases. However, the functional variants underlying these disease associations remain largely unknown. There is evidence that microRNA-mediated regulation may play an important role in this context. Therefore, we assessed whether autoimmune disease loci unfold their effects via altering microRNA expression in relevant immune cells. To this end, we performed comprehensive data integration of many large and publicly available datasets to combine information on autoimmune disease risk loci with RNA-Seq-based microRNA expression data. Specifically, we carried out microRNA expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses across 115 GWAS regions associated with 12 autoimmune diseases using next-generation sequencing data of 345 lymphoblastoid cell lines. Statistical analyses included the application and extension of a recently proposed framework (joint likelihood mapping) to microRNA expression data and microRNA target gene enrichment analyses of relevant GWAS data. Overall, only a minority of autoimmune disease risk loci may exert their pathophysiologic effects by altering microRNA expression based on JLIM. However, detailed functional fine-mapping revealed two independent GWAS regions harboring autoimmune disease risk SNPs with significant effects on microRNA expression. These relate to SNPs associated with Crohn's disease (CD; rs102275) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA; rs968567), which affect the expression of miR-1908-5p (p<sub>rs102275</sub> = 1.44e-20, p<sub>rs968567</sub> = 2.54e-14). In addition, an independent CD risk SNP, rs3853824, was found to alter the expression of miR-3614-5p (p = 5.70e-7). To support these findings, we demonstrate that GWAS signals for RA and CD were enriched in genes predicted to be targeted by both microRNAs (all with p &lt; 0.05). In summary, our study points towards a potential pathophysiological role of miR-1908-5p and miR-3614-5p in autoimmunity.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms underpinning M28 GAS pathogenesis. Whole-genome sequencing studies of M28 GAS strains recovered from patients with invasive infections found an unexpectedly high number of missense (amino acid-changing) and nonsense (protein-truncating) polymorphisms in <i>rocA</i> (<u>r</u>egulator <u>o</u>f <u>C</u>ov), leading us to hypothesize that altered RocA activity contributes to M28 GAS molecular pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, an isogenic <i>rocA</i> deletion mutant strain was created. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that RocA inactivation significantly alters the level of transcripts for 427 and 323 genes at mid-exponential and early stationary growth phases, respectively, including genes for 41 transcription regulators and 21 virulence factors. In contrast, RocA transcriptomes from other GAS M protein serotypes are much smaller and include fewer transcription regulators. The <i>rocA</i> mutant strain had significantly increased secreted activity of multiple virulence factors and grew to significantly higher colony counts under acid stress <i>in vitro</i> RocA inactivation also significantly increased GAS virulence in a mouse model of necrotizing myositis. Our results demonstrate that RocA is an important regulator of transcription regulators and virulence factors in M28 GAS and raise the possibility that naturally occurring polymorphisms in <i>rocA</i> in some fashion contribute to human invasive infections caused by M28 GAS strains.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</CopyrightInformation> "

The aim of this study is to explore the differentially expressed genes and novel microRNA regulations potentially implicated in the dysregulated cartilage homeostasis in joint destruction of RA. Total RNAs were extracted from human primary cultured normal and RA chondrocytes for RNA and small RNA expression profiling using next-generation sequencing. Using systematic bioinformatics analyses, we identified 463 differentially expressed genes in RA chondrocytes were enriched in biological functions related to altered cell cycle process, inflammatory response and hypoxic stimulation. Moreover, fibroblast growth factor 9 (<i>FGF9</i>), kynureninase (<i>KYNU</i>), and regulator of cell cycle (<i>RGCC</i>) were among the top dysregulated genes identified to be potentially affected in the RA joint microenvironment, having similar expression patterns observed in arrays of clinical RA synovial tissues from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Additionally, among the 31 differentially expressed microRNAs and 10 candidate genes with potential microRNA-mRNA interactions in RA chondrocytes, the novel miR-140-3p-<i>FGF9</i> interaction was validated in different microRNA prediction databases, and proposed to participate in the pathogenesis of joint destruction through dysregulated cell growth in RA. The findings provide new perspectives for target genes in the management of cartilage destruction in RA.</AbstractText> "

However, the genetic basis of functional rare variants in sarcoidosis still needs to be explored. To identify functional rare variants in sarcoidosis, we sequenced exomes of 22 sarcoidosis cases from six families. Variants were prioritized using linkage and high-penetrance approaches, and filtered to identify novel and rare variants. Functional networking and pathway analysis of identified variants was performed using gene ontology based gene-phenotype, gene-gene, and protein-protein interactions. The linkage (n = 1007-7640) and high-penetrance (n = 11,432) prioritized variants were filtered to select variants with (a) reported allele frequency &lt; 5% in databases (1.2-3.4%) or (b) novel (0.7-2.3%). Further selection based on functional properties and validation revealed a panel of 40 functional rare variants (33 from linkage region, 6 highly penetrant and 1 shared by both approaches). Functional network analysis implicated these gene variants in immune responses, such as regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including production of IFN-γ and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, leukocyte proliferation, bacterial defence, and vesicle-mediated transport. The KEGG pathway analysis indicated inflammatory bowel disease as most relevant. This study highlights the subsets of functional rare gene variants involved in pulmonary sarcoidosis, such as, regulations of calcium ions, G-protein-coupled receptor, and immune system including retinoic acid binding. The implicated mechanisms in etiopathogenesis of familial sarcoidosis thus include Wnt signalling, inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signalling and cadherin signalling pathways.</AbstractText> "

Among disease-related miRNAs of PB Tregs we identified miR-155 and miR-223. Moreover, looking at the global transcriptome of PB Tregs, we recognized alterations in TLR-2 signaling pathway and in the downstream of NF-κB apoptosis and proliferation signals. However, induction of TLR-2 expression was found not only in Tregs, but also in the heterogeneous population of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as well as two PBMC subpopulations (CD4+/CD25-and CD4-/CD25-) of patients with PS.

"196";"29997562";"The Diagnostic Value of MRI Pattern Recognition in Distal Myopathies.";" <AbstractText><b>Objective:</b> Distal myopathies are a diagnostically challenging group of diseases. We wanted to understand the value of MRI in the current clinical setting and explore the potential for optimizing its clinical application. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively audited the diagnostic workup in a distal myopathy patient cohort, reassessing the diagnosis, whilst documenting the usage of MRI. We established a literature based distal myopathies MRI pattern template and assessed its diagnostic utility in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and potential impact on the diagnostic workup. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-five patients were included; in 38 with a comprehensive set of data the diagnostic work-up was audited. The median time from symptoms onset to diagnosis was 12.1 years. The initial genetic diagnostic rate was 39%; 18% were misdiagnosed as neuropathies and 13% as inclusion body myositis (IBM). Based on 21 publications we established a MRI pattern template. Its overall sensitivity (50%) and specificity (32%) were low. However in some diseases (e.g., <i>MYOT</i>-related myopathy, <i>TTN</i>-HMERF) MRI correctly identified the causative gene. The number of genes suggested by MRI pattern analysis was smaller compared to clinical work up (median 1 vs. 9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) but fewer genes were correctly predicted (5/10 vs. 7/10). MRI analysis ruled out IBM in all cases. <b>Conclusion:</b> In the diagnostic work-up of distal myopathies, MRI is useful in assisting genetic testing and avoiding misdiagnosis (IBM). The overall low sensitivity and specificity limits its generalized use when traditional single gene test methods are applied. However, in the context of next generation sequencing MRI may represent a valuable tool for interpreting complex genetic results.</AbstractText> "

The Accelerating Medicines Partnership RA/SLE Network aims to deconstruct autoimmune pathology by examining cells within target tissues through multiple high-dimensional assays. Robust standardized protocols need to be developed before cellular phenotypes at a single cell level can be effectively compared across patient samples.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Multiple clinical sites collected cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments from arthroplasty and synovial biopsy in a 10% DMSO solution. Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation parameters were optimized for viable cell extraction and surface protein preservation for cell sorting and mass cytometry, as well as for reproducibility in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Cryopreserved synovial samples were collectively analyzed at a central processing site by a custom-designed and validated 35-marker mass cytometry panel. In parallel, each sample was flow sorted into fibroblast, T-cell, B-cell, and macrophage suspensions for bulk population RNA-seq and plate-based single-cell CEL-Seq2 RNA-seq.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Upon dissociation, cryopreserved synovial tissue fragments yielded a high frequency of viable cells, comparable to samples undergoing immediate processing. Optimization of synovial tissue dissociation across six clinical collection sites with ~ 30 arthroplasty and ~ 20 biopsy samples yielded a consensus digestion protocol using 100 μg/ml of Liberase™ TL enzyme preparation. This protocol yielded immune and stromal cell lineages with preserved surface markers and minimized variability across replicate RNA-seq transcriptomes. Mass cytometry analysis of cells from cryopreserved synovium distinguished diverse fibroblast phenotypes, distinct populations of memory B cells and antibody-secreting cells, and multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell activation states. Bulk RNA-seq of sorted cell populations demonstrated robust separation of synovial lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Single-cell RNA-seq produced transcriptomes of over 1000 genes/cell, including transcripts encoding characteristic lineage markers identified.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We have established a robust protocol to acquire viable cells from cryopreserved synovial tissue with intact transcriptomes and cell surface phenotypes. A centralized pipeline to generate multiple high-dimensional analyses of synovial tissue samples collected across a collaborative network was developed. Integrated analysis of such datasets from large patient cohorts may help define molecular heterogeneity within RA pathology and identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.</AbstractText> "

M1 or M2-polarised macrophages in synovial tissues of patients with OA and OA mice were analysed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining. Mice with tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or Rheb deletion specifically in the myeloid lineage were generated and subjected to intra-articular injection of collagenase (collagenase-induced osteoarthritis, CIOA) and destabilisation of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to induce OA. Cartilage damage and osteophyte size were measured by Osteoarthritis Research Society International score and micro-CT, respectively. mRNA sequencing was performed in M1 and control macrophages. Mice and ATDC5 cells were treated with R-spondin-2 (Rspo2) or anti-Rspo2 to investigate the role of Rspo2 in OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">M1 but not M2-polarised macrophages accumulated in human and mouse OA synovial tissue. TSC1 deletion in the myeloid lineage constitutively activated mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), increased M1 polarisation in synovial macrophages and exacerbated experimental OA in both CIOA and DMM models, while Rheb deletion inhibited mTORC1, enhanced M2 polarisation and alleviated CIOA in mice. The results show that promoting the macrophage M1 polarisation leads to exacerbation of experimental OA partially through secretion of Rspo2 and activation of β-catenin signalling in chondrocytes.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Synovial macrophage M1 polarisation exacerbates experimental CIOA partially through Rspo2.

Here we seek a genetic basis for this differential response. From 1341 patients enrolled in the ProCESS trial of early goal directed therapy for septic shock, we selected 6 patients with MAS features and the highest ferritin, for whole exome sequencing (mean 24,030.7 ηg/ml, ±SEM 7,411.1). In total 11 rare (minor allele frequency &lt;5%) pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants causal for the monogenic disorders of Familial Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis, atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, Familial Mediterranean Fever, and Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Fever were identified. In these conditions, seven of the identified variants are currently targeted with IL1RA and four with anti-C5 antibody.

Differences from a reference sequence (GRCh38) were identified. The sequence kernel association test (SKAT) was applied to identify gout-associated alleles in mitochondrial genes. The tools Polymorphism Phenotyping, Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), Predict the pathology of Mutations (PMUT), Human Mitochondrial Genome Database (mtDB), Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform (MAFFT), and Mammalian Mitochondrial tRNA Genes (Mamit-tRNA) were used to evaluate pathogenicity of alleles. Validation of selected alleles by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of single nucleotide polymorphisms (qPCR SNPs) was also performed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We identified 456 alleles in patients with gout and 640 alleles in non-gout controls with 274 alleles shared by both. Mitochondrial genes were associated with gout, with MT-CO3, MT-TA, MT-TC, and MT-TT containing potentially pathogenic gout-associated alleles and displaying evidence of gene-gene interactions. All heteroplasmy levels of potentially pathogenic alleles exceeded metabolic thresholds for pathogenicity. Validation assays confirmed the next-generation sequencing results of selected alleles. Among them, potentially pathogenic MT-CO3 alleles correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (P = 0.034).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">This study provided two scientific insights. First, this was the most extensive mitochondrial genomic profiling associated with gout. Second, our results supported the roles of mitochondria in gout and HDL, and this comprehensive analysis framework can be applied to other diseases in which mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated.</AbstractText> "

The aetiology of joint pain in OA is not well understood. The synovial membrane as an innervated joint structure represents a potential source of peripheral pain in OA. Here we analyse, using a hypothesis-free next generation RNA sequencing, the differences in protein-coding and non-coding transcriptomes in knee synovial tissues from OA patients with high knee pain (<i>n</i> = 5) compared with OA patients with low knee pain (<i>n</i> = 5), as evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS). We conduct Gene Ontology and pathway analyses on differentially expressed mRNA genes. We identify new protein-coding, long non-coding RNA and microRNA candidates that can be associated with OA joint pain. Top enriched genes in painful OA knees encode neuronal proteins that are known to promote neuronal survival under cellular stress or participate in calcium-dependent synaptic exocytosis and modulation of GABA(&amp;gamma;-aminobutyric acid)ergic activity. Our study uncovers transcriptome changes associated with pain in synovial microenvironment of OA knees. This sets a firm ground for future mechanistic studies and drug discovery to alleviate joint pain in OA.</AbstractText> "

However, these symptoms may appear mild and non-specific. If these symptoms are unrecognized, thus delaying treatment, approximately 10% of LN patients will develop permanent kidney damage and end-stage kidney disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify a surrogate biomarker for the early detection of LN. In this study, we first adopted next generation sequencing (NGS) in order to screen differential expression levels of microRNA between SLE patients with and without LN. The results of both the NGS and the literature review confirmed the potential of 15 microRNAs through real-time qPCR. We further considered clinical laboratory data for additional analysis. In total, 41 microRNAs demonstrated significant differences through NGS screening. We then verified eight microRNAs from NGS and seven microRNAs from the literature review using the real-time qPCR method in peripheral mononuclear cells. Ultimately, mir-125a-5p, miR-146a-5p, and mir-221-3p were found to be statistically significant not only in the screening study but also in the real-time qPCR verification studies. miR-146a-5p was observed to have a significant correlation with clinical biochemistry markers, as well as to be a surrogate biomarker for the early detection of lupus nephritis. This study is the first to show that the intracellular biomarker miR-146a-5p may serve as a useful specific biomarker for the detection of lupus nephritis among lupus patients in the future, regardless of serum albumin levels and spot urine protein/creatinine ratio.</AbstractText> "

The aim of the present study was to use HMGB1 to treat RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) and to examine the changes of transcriptional factors. RASFs were isolated from synovial tissues obtained from five RA patients undergoing synovectomy or joint replacement. RASFs were incubated with 100 ng/mL of HMGB1 for different periods. The changes in transcriptional factors were screened by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. The results showed that the mRNA of &gt;60 genes in RASFs were differentially expressed after HMGB1 treatment. Among them, GBA1 was the most markedly decreased (-3.99 folds, P&lt;0.001). These results were confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blot. The late-stage inflammatory mediator HMGB1 probably exerts its pathogenic role in RA by downregulating GBA1.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>IJCEP Copyright © 2018.</CopyrightInformation> "

However, its molecular mechanisms on inner ear development are not clear. In this work, the inner ear morphology was investigated at different embryonic stages of the SOX10 mutation miniature porcine model with sensorineural hearing loss, and high-throughput RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses were applied. Our results indicated that the SOX10 mutation in the miniature pigs led to an incomplete partition (IP) of the cochlea, a cystic apex caused by fusion from middle and apical turns, cochlear modiolar defects and a shortened cochlear duct. The model demonstrated 173 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 185 differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The down-regulated DEGs most significantly enriched the inflammatory mediator regulation of the TRP channels, arachidonic acid metabolism, and the salivary secretion pathways, while the up-regulated DEGs most significantly enriched the systemic lupus erythematosus and alcoholism pathways. Based on gene cluster analysis, we selected four gene groups: WNT1, KCNQ4, STRC and PAX6.</AbstractText> "

A number of studies have demonstrated that the expression of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) is dysregulated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). So far, all studies on miRNAs in RA patients have been performed using either microarray or reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. Compared to RT-qPCR and microarray analyses, next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows the genome-wide analysis of small RNAs and the differentiation between miRNAs that differ by a single nucleotide. The application of NGS to the analysis of small RNAs circulating in sera of RA patients has not been reported. This study provides a global overview of the circulating small RNAs in the sera of RA patients and healthy subjects and identifies differences between these groups using NGS. Several classes of small RNAs, including hY RNA-derived fragments, tRNA-derived fragments and miRNAs, were determined. Differentially expressed individual small RNAs were verified by RT-qPCR. The levels of two miRNAs, miR-223-3p and miR-16-5p, were significantly lower in the sera from early RA patients than in those from established RA patients and healthy controls. In contrast, the serum level of miR-16-5p was higher in patients with established RA than in healthy control samples. These miRNAs may not only serve as biomarkers, but may also shed more light on the pathophysiology of RA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2018 British Society for Immunology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"207";"29891556";"In Rheumatoid Arthritis, Synovitis at Different Inflammatory Sites Is Dominated by Shared but Patient-Specific T Cell Clones.";" <AbstractText>Genetic and immunological evidence clearly points to a role for T cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Selective targeting of such disease-associated T cell clones might be highly effective while having few side effects. However, such selective targeting may only be feasible if the same T cell clones dominate the immune response at different sites of inflammation. We leveraged high-throughput technology to quantitatively assess whether different T cell clones dominate the inflammatory infiltrate at various sites of inflammation in this prototypic autoimmune disease. In 13 RA patients, we performed quantitative next-generation sequencing-based human TCRβ repertoire analysis in simultaneously obtained samples from inflamed synovial tissue (ST) from distinct locations within one joint, from multiple joints, and from synovial fluid (SF) and peripheral blood (PB). Identical TCRβ clones dominate inflammatory responses in ST samples taken from different locations within a single joint and when sampled in different joints. Although overall ST-SF overlap was comparable to higher ST-ST values, the overlap in dominant TCRβ clones in ST-SF comparisons was much lower than ST-ST and comparable to the low ST-PB overlap. In individual RA patients, a limited number of TCRβ clones dominate the immune response in the inflamed ST regardless of the location within a joint and which joint undergoes biopsy; in contrast, there is limited overlap of ST with SF or PB TCR repertoires. This limited breadth of the T cell response in ST of the individual RA patient indicates that development of immunotherapies that selectively modulate dominant T cell responses might be feasible.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

We identified multiple rare likely pathogenic variants in nineteen genes co-segregating with the disease through multiple generations. Gene co-expression and protein-protein interaction analysis identified a network of highly connected genes comprising several loci previously implicated in autoimmune diseases. These genes were significantly enriched for immune system development, lymphocyte activation, DNA repair, and V(D)J gene recombination GO-categories. Furthermore, we found evidence of aggregate association and enrichment of rare variants at the FAM71E1/EMC10 locus in an independent set of 4,254 European SLE-cases and 4,349 controls. Our study presents evidence supporting that multiple rare likely pathogenic variants, in newly identified genes involved in known disease pathogenic pathways, segregate with SLE at the familial and population level.</AbstractText> "

However, the molecular basis of facet joint osteoarthritis remains largely undetermined. In the current study, we collected facet joint tissue samples from 10 control patients and 48 patients with facet joint osteoarthritis (20 patients with moderate degeneration and 28 with severe degeneration). The control patients underwent internal fixation of the lumbar spine due to vertebral fracture. RNA deep sequencing was performed, and Bioinformatic tools were applied. Among top 30 enriched signaling pathways, we focused on two inflammation-related signaling pathways, Wnt and NF-κB signaling pathways. Subsequently, using the quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we confirmed that in Wnt signaling pathway, the mRNA levels of Dickkopf WNT Signaling Pathway Inhibitor 2 (DKK2), Sex-determining Region Y-box 17 (SOX17), MYC, Cyclin D1, Calcium/Calmodulin Dependent Protein Kinase II Alpha (CAMK2A), and Wnt Family Member 11 and 5 were increased in facet joint osteoarthritis, while the mRNA levels of WNT Inhibitory Factor 1, Casein Kinase 1 Alpha 1, Transcription Factor 7/Lymphoid Enhancer Binding Factor 1 (TCF7/LEF1), and VANGL Planar Cell Polarity Protein 2 were decreased. In NF-κB signaling pathway, the mRNA levels of C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 4 (CCL4) and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 4 Like 2 (CCL4L2) were increased, while the mRNA levels of BCL2 Related Protein A1 were decreased. These results suggest that Wnt and NF-κB signaling may be altered in the process of facet joint cartilage degeneration.

"211";"29773173";"Gene expression in adverse reaction to metal debris around metal-on-metal arthroplasty: An RNA-Seq-based study.";" <AbstractText>Joint replacement surgery is a standard treatment of advanced osteoarthritis (OA). Since 2000, cobalt-chromium (CoCr) metal-on-metal (MoM) implants were widely used in hip arthroplasties. Some patients developed &quot;adverse reaction to metal debris&quot; (ARMD) around the prosthesis, resulting in a need for revision surgery. In the present study, we addressed the pathogenesis of ARMD by genome-wide expression analysis. Pseudosynovial ARMD tissue was obtained from revision surgery of Articular Surface Replacement (ASR, DePuy, Warsaw, IN, USA) hip arthroplasties. Control tissue was 1) OA synovium from primary hip arthroplasties and 2) inflammatory pseudosynovial tissue from metal-on-plastic (MoP) implant revisions. In ARMD tissue, the expression of 1446 genes was significantly increased and that of 1881 decreased as compared to OA synovium. Genes associated with immune response, tissue development and certain leukocyte signaling pathways were enriched in the differently (FC &gt; 2) expressed genes. The network analysis proposed PRKACB, CD2, CD52 and CD53 as the central regulators of the greatest (FC &gt; 10) differences. When ARMD tissue was compared to MoP tissue, the expression of 16 genes was significantly higher and that of 21 lower. Many of these genes were associated with redox homeostasis, metal ion binding and transport, macrophage activation and apoptosis. Interestingly, genes central to myofibroblast (AEBP1 and DES) and osteoclast (CCL21, TREM2 and CKB) development were upregulated in the MoP tissue. In network analysis, IL8, NQO1, GSTT1 and HMOX1 were identified as potential central regulators of the changes. In conclusion, excessive amounts of CoCr debris produced by MoM hip implants induces in a group of patients a unique adverse reaction characterized with enhanced expression of genes associated with inflammation, redox homeostasis, metal ion binding and transport, macrophage activation and apoptosis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018.

Plasminogen activator urokinase (PLAU) overexpression in dcSSc fibroblasts reduced myofibroblast differentiation and fibroblast migration, while nidogen-2 (NID2) knockdown promoted myofibroblast differentiation and fibroblast migration. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) depletion in dcSSc fibroblasts inhibited cell migration rates. Taken together, antifibrotic effects of MeCP2 were mediated, at least partly, through modulating PLAU, NID2 and ADA.

This mutation is the fourth mutation identified in exon 4.The most frequent mutation was R202Q, followed by M694V, E148Q, M680I, R761H, V726A and R354W.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">One of the most important aims of this study is to investigate the MEFV mutation type and genotype of migrants coming to Sanliurfa after the civil war of Syria. This study also examines the effect of the condition on the region&amp;rsquo;s gene pool and the distribution of different types of mutations. Our results indicated that MEFV mutations are highly heterogeneous in our patient population, which is consistent with the findings of other studies in our region. Previously used methods, such as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), do not define uncommon or especially novel mutations. Therefore, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of the MEFV gene could be useful for finding novel mutations, except for those located on exon 2 and 10.</AbstractText> "

This disorder is genetically heterogeneous with ∼7% of families genetically unresolved. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in two multiplex ADPKD-like pedigrees, and we analyzed a further 591 genetically unresolved, phenotypically similar families by targeted next-generation sequencing of 65 candidate genes. WES identified a DNAJB11 missense variant (p.Pro54Arg) in two family members presenting with non-enlarged polycystic kidneys and a frameshifting change (c.166_167insTT) in a second family with small renal and liver cysts. DNAJB11 is a co-factor of BiP, a key chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum controlling folding, trafficking, and degradation of secreted and membrane proteins. Five additional multigenerational families carrying DNAJB11 mutations were identified by the targeted analysis. The clinical phenotype was consistent in the 23 affected members, with non-enlarged cystic kidneys that often evolved to kidney atrophy; 7 subjects reached ESRD from 59 to 89 years. The lack of kidney enlargement, histologically evident interstitial fibrosis in non-cystic parenchyma, and recurring episodes of gout (one family) suggested partial phenotypic overlap with autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial diseases (ADTKD). Characterization of DNAJB11-null cells and kidney samples from affected individuals revealed a pathogenesis associated with maturation and trafficking defects involving the ADPKD protein, PC1, and ADTKD proteins, such as UMOD. DNAJB11-associated disease is a phenotypic hybrid of ADPKD and ADTKD, characterized by normal-sized cystic kidneys and progressive interstitial fibrosis resulting in late-onset ESRD.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 American Society of Human Genetics.

The effect of DVL2 on RA-FLS signaling pathway was detected by RNA-seq, and then the key genes were verified by RT-PCR. <b>Results:</b> Compared with the control group, DVL2 significantly increased the apoptosis rate of MH7A (3.2%±2.2% vs 25.7%±4.5%). RNA-seq results showed that DVL2 down-regulated the JAK-STAT pathway.The results of RT-PCR showed that DVL2 inhibited the gene expression of JAK2, Stat1, and Stat2; DVL2 still inhibited the gene expression of JAK2 and Stat2 but not Stat1 after TNF-α stimulation.DVL2 inhibited the gene expression of Bcl-xL, and the gene expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL after TNF-α stimulation. <b>Conclusion:</b> DVL2 can increase the apoptosis rate of RA-FLS through inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway and its downstream anti-apoptotic gene.</AbstractText> "

Genetic analysis is required to confirm the diagnosis. We aimed to describe the identifying symptoms and genotypes of patients referred to our reference centres and to improve the indications for genetic testing. DNA from 66 patients with clinically suspected DADA2 were sequenced by Sanger or next-generation sequencing. Detailed epidemiological, clinical and biological features were collected by use of a questionnaire and were compared between patients with and without genetic confirmation of DADA2. We identified 13 patients (19.6%) carrying recessively inherited mutations in ADA2 that were predicted to be deleterious. Eight patients were compound heterozygous for mutations. Seven mutations were novel (4 missense variants, 2 predicted to affect mRNA splicing and 1 frameshift). The mean age of the 13 patients with genetic confirmation was 12.7 years at disease onset and 20.8 years at diagnosis. Phenotypic manifestations included fever (85%), vasculitis (85%) and neurological disorders (54%). Features best associated with a confirmatory genotype included fever with neurologic or cutaneous attacks (odds ratio [OR] 10.71, p = 0.003 and OR 10.9, p &lt; 0.001), fever alone (OR 8.1, p = 0.01), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level with neurologic involvement (OR 6.63, p = 0.017). Our proposed decision tree may help improve obtaining genetic confirmation of DADA2 in the context of autoinflammatory symptoms. Prerequisites for quick and low-cost Sanger analysis include one typical cutaneous or neurological sign, one marker of inflammation (fever or elevated CRP level), and recurrent or chronic attacks in adults.</AbstractText> "

Ameliorating therapeutics are lacking due to limited understanding of the molecular pathways affecting disease initiation and progression. Notably, although a link between inflammation and overt OA is well established, the role of inflammation as a driver of disease occurrence is highly disputed. We analyzed a family with dominant inheritance of early-onset OA and found that affected individuals harbored a rare variant allele encoding a significant amino acid change (p.Asn104Asp) in the kinase domain of receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2), which transduces signals from activated bacterial peptidoglycan sensors through the NF-κB pathway to generate a proinflammatory immune response. Functional analyses of RIPK2 activity in zebrafish embryos indicated that the variant RIPK2104Asp protein is hyperactive in its signaling capacity, with augmented ability to activate the innate immune response and the NF-κB pathway and to promote upregulation of OA-associated genes. Further we show a second allele of RIPK2 linked to an inflammatory disease associated with arthritis also has enhanced activity stimulating the NF-κB pathway. Our studies reveal for the first time the inflammatory response can function as a gatekeeper risk factor for OA.</AbstractText> "

"223";"29614084";"Identification of HLA-DRB1 association to adalimumab immunogenicity.";" <AbstractText>Anti-drug antibody formation occurs with most biological agents across disease states, but the mechanism by which they are formed is unknown. The formation of anti-drug antibodies to adalimumab (AAA) may decrease its therapeutic effects in some patients. HLA alleles have been reported to be associated with autoantibody formation against interferons and other TNF inhibitors, but not adalimumab. We analyzed samples from 634 subjects with either rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or hidradenitis suppurativa (HS): 37 subjects (17 RA and 20 HS) developed AAA (AAA+) during adalimumab treatment and 597 subjects (348 RA, 249 HS) did not develop AAA (AAA-) during the clinical trials. Using next-generation sequencing-based HLA typing, we identified three protective HLA alleles (HLA-DQB1*05, HLA-DRB1*01,and HLA-DRB1*07) that were less prevalent in AAA+ than AAA-subjects (ORs: 0.4, 0.25 and 0.28, respectively; and P values: 0.012, 0.012 and 0.018, respectively) and two risk HLA alleles (HLA-DRB1*03 and HLA-DRB1*011) that were more abundant in AAA+ than AAA-subjects (ORs: 2.52, and 2.64, respectively; and P values: 0.006 and 0.019). Similar to the finding of Billiet et al. who found that carriage of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele was more prevalent in those with anti-infliximab antibodies (OR = 3.6, p = 0.002, 95% CI: [1.5,8.6]).), we found HLA-DRB1*03 allele was also more prevalent in anti-adalimumab positive (OR = 2.52, p = 0.006, 95% CI: [1.37,4.63]).

The recent outbreaks in America and unexpected association between ZIKV infection and birth defects have triggered the global attention. This vouches to understand the molecular mechanisms of ZIKV infection to develop effective drug therapy. A systems-level understanding of biological process affected by ZIKV infection in fetal brain sample led us to identify the candidate genes for pharmaceutical intervention and potential biomarkers for diagnosis. To identify the key genes, transcriptomics data (RNA-Seq) with GSE93385 of ZIKV (Strain: MR766) infected human fetal neural stem cell are analyzed. In total, 1,084 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified, that is, 471 upregulated and 613 downregulated genes. Further analysis such as the gene ontology term suggested that the downregulated genes are mostly enriched in defense response to virus, receptor binding, laminin binding, extracellular matrix, endoplasmic reticulum, and for upregulated DEGs: translation initiation, RNA binding, cytosol, and nucleosome are enriched. And through pathway analysis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is found to be the most enriched pathway. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is constructed to find the hub genes using STRING database. The seven key genes namely cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cyclin B1 (CCNB1), histone cluster 1 H2B family member K, (HIST1H2BK) histone cluster 1 H2B family member O (HIST1H2BO), and histone cluster 1 H2B family member B (HIST1H2BB), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), and cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) with highest degree are found to be hub genes using Centiscape, a Cytoscape plugin. The modules of PPI network using Molecular Complex Detection plugin are found significant in structural constituent of ribosome, defense response to virus, nucleosome, SLE, extracellular region, and regulation of gene silencing. Thus, identified key hub genes and pathways shed light on molecular mechanism that may contribute to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and development of new strategies for the intervention of ZIKV disease.</AbstractText> "

Array studies of total peripheral blood mononuclear cells have demonstrated gene expression signatures related to neutrophils, interferon, and other inflammatory pathways. It is not clear how consistent these effects are across different cell types. In this study, RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq were utilized to identify gene expression patterns and H3K4me3 histone modifications related to promoter activation in SLE. Across the three cell types, there was 55% concordance for gene expression changes related to SLE. Key conserved pathways were ribosome biogenesis among upregulated genes and heat shock response among downregulated genes. ETS family transcription factors (TFs) and STAT1 were revealed as common regulators by position weight matrices. When epigenetic changes were leveraged with gene expression, the pivotal TFs ATF3 and FOS were defined with ATF3 also cross-referencing with gene expression-identified TFs. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with SLE were cross-referenced with both mRNA and H3K4me3 changes in SLE. Baseline mRNA expression and H3K4me3 peak height was higher at sites that cross-referenced with GWAS signals, however, all three cell types exhibited an overall decrease in expression of GWAS-associated RNAs differentially expressed in SLE. H3K4me3 changes in SLE were also enriched in GWAS-associated sites. In summary, the SLE disease process is associated with both shared and cell-specific changes in gene expression and epigenetics. Surprisingly, GWAS-associated RNAs were overall markedly decreased across all three cell types. TF analysis identified ATF3, FOS, STAT1, and ETS family members as critical, all pathways with a recognized relationship to the SLE disease process. GWAS signals clearly mark both cell-type specific changes in SLE as well as concordant changes across all three cell types. Interpretation of single nucleotide polymorphism effects in SLE will require tissue-specific mechanistic studies and therapeutics will require mechanistic studies in multiple cell types.</AbstractText> "

Here, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 784 patients undergoing placebo treatment in Phase III Asthma or Rheumatoid Arthritis trials to assess the impact of previously reported variation on patient outcomes in the placebo arms and to identify novel variants associated with the placebo response. Contrary to expectations based on previous reports, we did not observe any statistically significant associations between genomic variants and placebo treatment outcome.

Associated haplotypes within this region encompassed 38 annotated genes, including four myosin genes (MYH1, MYH2, MYH3, and MYH13). Whole genome sequencing of four IMM and four unaffected QHs identified a single segregating nonsynonymous E321G mutation in MYH1 encoding myosin heavy chain 2X. Genotyping of additional 35 IMM and 22 unaffected QHs confirmed an association (P = 2.9 × 10<sup>- 5</sup>), and the putative mutation was absent in 175 horses from 21 non-QH breeds. Lymphocytic infiltrates occurred in type 2X myofibers and the proportion of 2X fibers was decreased in the presence of inflammation. Protein modeling and contact/stability analysis identified 14 residues affected by the mutation which significantly decreased stability.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">We conclude that a mutation in MYH1 is highly associated with susceptibility to the IMM phenotype in QH-related breeds.

To address this, we developed a 3D-printed, low-cost droplet microfluidic control instrument and deploy it in a clinical environment to perform single-cell transcriptome profiling of disaggregated synovial tissue from five rheumatoid arthritis patients. We sequence 20,387 single cells revealing 13 transcriptomically distinct clusters. These encompass an unsupervised draft atlas of the autoimmune infiltrate that contribute to disease biology. Additionally, we identify previously uncharacterized fibroblast subpopulations and discern their spatial location within the synovium. We envision that this instrument will have broad utility in both research and clinical settings, enabling low-cost and routine application of microfluidic techniques.</AbstractText> "

Thickened valve areas consist almost entirely of hyperproliferative <i>ColVI</i>-expressing mesenchymal VICs. Development of pathology results in valve stenosis and left ventricular dysfunction, accompanied by arrhythmic episodes and, occasionally, valvular regurgitation. TNF dependency of the pathology was indicated by disease modulation following pharmacological inhibition or mesenchymal-specific genetic ablation or activation of TNF/TNFR1 signalling. Tg197-derived VICs exhibited an activated phenotype <i>ex viv</i>o, reminiscent of the activated pathogenic phenotype of Tg197-derived SFs.

Muscle biopsy showed pathological features consistent with mitochondrial myopathy. In both cases, a single large deletion in mitochondrial DNA at low-level heteroplasmy was identified by next-generation sequencing in muscle tissue. In 1 case, the deletion was identified in muscle tissue but not blood. In both cases, the deletion was only identified on next-generation sequencing of muscle mitochondrial DNA and missed on array comparative genome hybridization testing. These cases demonstrate that next-generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA in muscle tissue is the most sensitive method of molecular diagnosis for mitochondrial myopathy due to mitochondrial DNA deletions.</AbstractText> "

Biopsy specimens obtained from patients with RA and synovial tissue from patients with osteoarthritis (OA) were subjected to histologic analysis, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). An optimized protocol for digesting synovial tissue was developed to generate high-quality RNA-seq libraries from isolated macrophage populations. Associations were determined between macrophage transcriptional profiles and clinical parameters in RA patients.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Patients with RA reported minimal adverse effects in response to synovial biopsy.

This study used RNA-seq to profile the transcriptome of primary epidermal keratinocytes (KCs) treated with IL-1B, IL-36A, IL-36B, or IL-36G. We identified some early IL-1B-specific responses (8 h posttreatment), but nearly all late IL-1B responses were replicated by IL-36 cytokines (24 h posttreatment). Type I and II interferon genes exhibited time-dependent response patterns, with early induction (8 h) followed by no response or repression (24 h). Altogether, we identified 225 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with shared responses to all 4 cytokines at both time points (8 and 24 h). These involved upregulation of ligands (<i>IL1A, IL1B</i>, and <i>IL36G</i>) and activating proteases (<i>CTSS</i>) but also upregulation of inhibitors such as <i>IL1RN</i> and <i>IL36RN</i>. Shared IL-1B/IL-36 DEGs overlapped significantly with genes altered in PsV and GPP skin lesions, as well as genes near GWAS loci linked to autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases (e.g., PsV, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and primary biliary cholangitis). Inactivation of MyD88 adapter protein using CRISPR/Cas9 completely abolished expression responses of such DEGs to IL-1B and IL-36G stimulation. These results provide a global view of IL-1B and IL-36 expression responses in epidermal KCs with fine-scale characterization of time-dependent and cytokine-specific response patterns. Our findings support an important role for IL-1B and IL-36 in autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions and show that MyD88 adaptor protein mediates shared IL-1B/IL-36 responses.</AbstractText> "

This repertoire is usually defined in terms of amino acid composition. However, variable domains may also acquire <i>N</i>-linked glycans, a process conditional on the introduction of consensus amino acid motifs (<i>N</i>-glycosylation sites) during somatic hypermutation. High levels of variable domain glycans have been associated with autoantibodies in rheumatoid arthritis, as well as certain follicular lymphomas. However, the role of these glycans in the humoral immune response remains poorly understood. Interestingly, studies have reported both positive and negative effects on antibody affinity. Our aim was to elucidate the role of variable domain glycans during antigen-specific antibody responses. By analyzing B-cell repertoires by next-generation sequencing, we demonstrate that <i>N</i>-glycosylation sites are introduced at positions in which glycans can affect antigen binding as a result of a specific clustering of progenitor glycosylation sites in the germline sequences of variable domain genes. By analyzing multiple human monoclonal and polyclonal (auto)antibody responses, we subsequently show that this process is subject to selection during antigen-specific antibody responses, skewed toward IgG4, and positively contributes to antigen binding. Together, these results highlight a physiological role for variable domain glycosylation as an additional layer of antibody diversification that modulates antigen binding.</AbstractText> "

Swelling of wrists, knees, and elbows began before 4 years of age, while the age of joint involvement was variable. Patients reported an increased pain level after the age of 10, and severe hip involvement developed after 20 years old. All patients presented developmental coxa vara and seven patients (~22%) had pleural effusion, pericarditis, and/or ascites. We identified nine novel genomic alterations, including the first case of homozygous complete deletion of exon 1 in the PRG4 gene.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">With this study, we contribute to the catalog of CACP causing variants. We confirm that the skeletal component of this disease worsens with age, and presents the potential mechanisms for interfamily variability, by discussing the influence of a modifier gene and escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.

In these cases, exome sequencing serves as a powerful instrument to determine the underlying genetic causes. Here, we present the case of a 4-year old boy with proteinuria, microhematuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, livedo-like rash, recurrent abdominal pain, anemia and continuously elevated CRP. Single exome sequencing revealed the pathogenic nonsense mutation p.(Arg98*) in the CLCN5 gene causing the X-linked inherited, renal tubular disorder Dent's disease. Furthermore, the two pathogenic and compound heterozygous missense variants p.(Gly47Ala) and p.(Pro251Leu) in the CECR1 gene could be identified. Mutations in the CECR1 gene are associated with a hereditary form of polyarteritis nodosa, called ADA2-deficiency. Both parents were carriers of a single heterozygous variant in CECR1 and the mother was carrier of the CLCN5 variant. This case evidently demonstrates the advantage of whole exome sequencing compared to single gene testing as the pathology in the CECR1 gene might have only been diagnosed after the occurrence of signs of systemic vasculitis like strokes or hemorrhages. Therefore, treatment and prevention can now start early to improve the outcome of these patients.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study is to explore the differentially expressed genes in normal and aged osteoblasts and to identify genes potentially involved in age-related alteration in bone physiology. Based on next generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, 12 differentially expressed microRNAs and 22 differentially expressed genes were identified. Up-regulation of miR-204-5p was validated in an array of osteoporotic hip fracture in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE74209). The putative targets for miR-204-5p were Kruppel-like factor 7 (<i>KLF7</i>) and SRY-box 11 (<i>SOX11</i>). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified <i>SOX11</i>, involved in osteoarthritis pathway and differentiation of osteoblasts, together with miR-204-5p, a potential upstream regulator, suggesting the critical role of miR-204-5p-<i>SOX11</i> regulation in the aging process of human bones. In addition, as semaphorin 3A (<i>SEMA3A</i>) and ephrin type-A receptor 5 (<i>EPHA5</i>) were involved in nervous system related biological functions, we postulated a potential linkage between <i>SEMA3A</i>, <i>EPHA5</i> and development of neurogenic heterotopic ossification. Our findings implicate new candidate genes in the diagnosis of geriatric musculoskeletal disorders, and provide novel insights that may contribute to the elaboration of new biomarkers for neurogenic heterotopic ossification.</AbstractText> "

The aim of this study was to elucidate the HCMV gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of SLE patients and demonstrate the effect and mechanism of viral gene associated with SLE in mono-macrophages functions. Using two RNA-Seq techniques in combination with RT-PCR, 11 viral genes mainly associated with latent HCMV infection were identified in the PBMCs of SLE patients. Among these viral genes, US31 with previously unknown function was highly expressed in the PBMCs of SLE patients compared to healthy controls. Analysis of function indicated that US31 expression could induce inflammation in monocyte and macrophage and stimulate macrophage differentiation toward an M1 macrophage phenotype. Screening via protein chips in combination with bioinformatic analysis and consequent detection of mono-macrophages function indicates that the direct interaction between US31 and NF-κB2 contributed the NF-kB2 activation. Consequent analysis indicated US31 directly interacted with NF-κB2, contribute to the polyubiquitination of the phosphorylated p100 and consequent activation of NF-κB2. Taken together, our data uncovered a previously unknown role of the HCMV protein US31 in inducing NF-κB-mediated mono-macrophage inflammation in the pathogenesis and development of SLE. Our findings provide a foundation for the continued investigation of novel therapeutic targets for SLE patients.</AbstractText> "

However, genetic and environmental factors involved in RA pathogenesis are still remained largely unknown. To identify the genetic causal variants underlying pathogenesis and disease progression of RA patients, we undertook the first comprehensive whole-exome sequencing (WES) study in a total of 124 subjects including 58 RA cases and 66 healthy controls in Han Chinese population. We identified 378 novel genes that were enriched with deleterious variants in RA patients using a gene burden test. The further functional effects of associated genetic genes were classified and assessed, including 21 newly identified genes that were involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, focal adhesion and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways relevant to RA pathogenesis. Moreover, six pathogenic variants were investigated and structural analysis predicted their potentially functional alteration by homology modeling. Importantly, five novel and rare homozygous variants (<i>NCR3LG1</i>, <i>RAP1GAP</i>, <i>CHCHD5</i>, <i>HIPK2</i> and <i>DIAPH2</i>) were identified, which may exhibit more functional impact on RA pathogenesis. Notably, 7 genes involved in the olfactory transduction pathway were enriched and associated with RA disease progression. Therefore, we performed an efficient and powerful technique WES in Chinese RA patients and identified novel, rare and common disease causing genes that alter innate immunity pathways and contribute to the risk of RA. Findings in this study may provide potential diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for RA patients.</AbstractText> "

A 10 gene subgroup classifier was validated by RT-qPCR in 16 further patients with OA. Pathway analysis showed increased protein expression in both groups. PhenomeExpress analysis revealed group differences in complement activation, innate immune responses and altered Wnt and TGFβ signalling, but no activation of inflammatory cytokine expression. Both groups showed suppressed circadian regulators and whereas matrix changes in Group A were chondrogenic, in Group B they were non-chondrogenic with changes in mechanoreceptors, calcium signalling, ion channels and in cytoskeletal organisers.

"245";"29247798";"Circular RNA expression profile of articular chondrocytes in an IL-1β-induced mouse model of osteoarthritis.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a widely prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by articular cartilage degradation and joint inflammation. The pathogenesis of OA remains unclear, leading to a lack of effective treatment. Previous studies have reported that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in the development of various diseases. However, the function of circRNAs and their roles in OA is largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate changes in circRNA expression and predict their functions in OA by using bioinformatics analysis. An OA model was established in mouse articular chondrocytes (MACs) treated by interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and then the circRNA profile was screened by Next Generation Sequencing. By comparing circRNA expression in IL-1β- treated MACs and normal controls, differentially expressed circRNAs were identified during OA pathogenesis, and differential expression levels of selected circRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were employed to predict the functions of these circRNAs. Because circRNAs can act as &quot;miRNA sponges&quot;, we also constructed a circRNA-miRNA network to predict their functions. A total of 255 circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in IL-1β-treated MACs (p≤0.05; fold-change≥2) from the expression of the normal controls. Among them, 119 circRNAs were significantly up-regulated, and the other 136 were down-regulated. Seven circRNAs were randomly selected to verify the reliability of these profiles by quantitative qRT-PCR. After obtaining the parental genes of differentially expressed circRNA, the top 30 enrichment GO entries and KEGG pathways were annotated. Then, two significantly differentially expressed circRNAs (mmu-circRNA-30365 and mmu-circRNA-36866) were identified and selected for further analysis, meanwhile a circRNA-miRNA regulation network was created and the top five most likely functional-related target miRNAs of the circRNAs were collected. Although the exact mechanisms and biological functions of these circRNAs in the development of OA need further exploration, our findings do suggest that the differentially expressed circRNAs were involved in the pathogenesis of OA. Thus, our study brings us closer to understanding the pathogenic mechanisms and finding new molecular targets for the clinical treatment of osteoarthritis.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we systematically analyzed the aberrant expression patterns of cervical cancer using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We incorporated gene profiling, molecular signatures, functional and pathway information with gene set enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, to identify sub-networks of genes. Those identified genes relating to DNA replication and DNA repair-mediated signaling pathways associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Next, we combined cross-validated prognostic scores to build an integrated prognostic model for survival prediction. The combined approach revealed that the DNA repair-mediated including the functional interaction module of 18 histone genes (Histone cluster 1 H2A, B and H4), were significantly correlated with the survival rate. Furthermore, five of these histone genes were highly expressed in three cervical cancer cohorts from the Oncomine database. Comparison of high and low histone variant-expressing human cervical cancer cell lines revealed different responses to DNA damage, suggesting protective functions of histone genes against DNA damage. Collectively, we provide evidence that two SLE-associated gene sets (HIST1H2BD and HIST1H2BJ; and HIST1H2BD, HIST1H2BJ, HIST1H2BH, HIST1H2AM and HIST1H4K) can be used as prognostic factors for survival prediction among cervical cancer patients.</AbstractText> "

Rare variant associations, expected to explain far less of the heritability, may be enriched in core disease genes and thus will be instrumental in the understanding of complex disease pathogenesis and their potential therapeutic targets. Here, using complementary whole-exome sequencing, high-density imputation, and in vitro cellular assays, we identify candidate core genes in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Using extreme-phenotype sampling, we sequenced the exomes of 30 SLE parent-affected-offspring trios and identified 14 genes with missense de novo mutations (DNM), none of which are within the &gt;80 SLE susceptibility loci implicated through genome-wide association studies. In a follow-up cohort of 10, 995 individuals of matched European ancestry, we imputed genotype data to the density of the combined UK10K-1000 genomes Phase III reference panel across the 14 candidate genes. Gene-level analyses indicate three functional candidates: DNMT3A, PRKCD, and C1QTNF4. We identify a burden of rare variants across PRKCD associated with SLE risk (P = 0.0028), and across DNMT3A associated with two severe disease prognosis sub-phenotypes (P = 0.0005 and P = 0.0033). We further characterise the TNF-dependent functions of the third candidate gene C1QTNF4 on NF-κB activation and apoptosis, which are inhibited by the p.His198Gln DNM. Our results identify three novel genes in SLE susceptibility and support extreme-phenotype sampling and DNM gene discovery to aid the search for core disease genes implicated through rare variation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author(s) 2017.

The diversity and stability of the immune system could be measured by hypervariable complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) segments of the T cell receptor (TCR). Here we used a combination of multiplex PCR and next-generation sequencing to conduct a good quality analysis of the T-cell receptor BV complementarity-determining region 3 (TCR BV CDR3) gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 7 sarcoidosis patients and lung sarcoidosis tissue from 6 patients. The length distribution of CDR3 sequences identified a significant difference among CD4+, CD8+ and tissue samples. The analysis of Gini coefficient, Shannon entropy and HEC number showed that they all presents in sarcoidosis tissue group clones in a more skewed manner than that of in PMBCs groups. 2 nucleotide sequences and 2 amino acid sequences were shared by all samples. The comparison of TRBV, TRBJ usage and VJ combination frequency identified 2 TRBV genes, 2 TRBJ genes differentially expressed among different groups and different higher usage and lower usage of V-J combinations between each group.</AbstractText> "

Rare deleterious gene variants driving relevant molecular pathways may play a key role in the pathogenesis and genetic control of common diseases and may also influence the common gene variants observed in GWAS. We use molecular profiling technologies based on massive sequencing of genes to interrogate clinical samples for a variety of molecules involved in the pathogenesis pathways of OA and also to derive new insights for drug targeting discovery at an early stage of the disease. By whole-exome sequencing performed in OA patients with extreme phenotypes and in non-related individuals without clinical evidence of OA, the most predominant of the rare gene variants found were non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (SNV) from exonic DNA regions and with missense functional effects predicting a moderate impact on protein function. A total of 629, 577, and 639 gene variants for the TPF, COA, and ANHNF patients, respectively, were found not to be shared with the 20 non-disease-related individuals. After subtraction of the 306 variants shared among the OA patients, we obtained the individual profiles of 323, 271, and 333 gene variants, for the TPF, COA, and ANHNF patients, respectively. After filtering by the bioinformatics, genetic, and biological criteria established to assess the clinical consequences, comparative analysis of trio sequences using integrative genome visualization tool clearly demonstrate the differences between patients. Analysis of the collagen gene variants identified 78, 20, and 43 genetic collagen variants for the three extreme phenotypes. Rare gene variants encoding for proteins that are less abundant in the trabecular bone matrix, together with those responsible for the control and regulation of bone turnover and plasticity of subchondral trabecular bone, play important roles in OA and help to define the clinical phenotype.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study is to explore novel microRNAs differentially expressed in RA osteoblasts and to identify genes potentially involved in the dysregulated bone homeostasis in RA. RNAs were extracted from cultured normal and RA osteoblasts for sequencing. Using the next generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, we identified 35 differentially expressed microRNAs and 13 differentially expressed genes with potential microRNA-mRNA interactions in RA osteoblasts. The 13 candidate genes were involved mainly in cell-matrix adhesion, as classified by the Gene Ontology. Two genes of interest identified from RA osteoblasts, A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (<i>AKAP12</i>) and leucin rich repeat containing 15 (<i>LRRC15</i>), were found to express more consistently in the related RA synovial tissue arrays in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, with the predicted interactions with miR-183-5p and miR-146a-5p, respectively. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified <i>AKAP12</i> as one of the genes involved in protein kinase A signaling and the function of chemotaxis, interconnecting with molecules related to neovascularization. The findings indicate new candidate genes as the potential indicators in evaluating therapies targeting chemotaxis and neovascularization to control joint destruction in RA.</AbstractText> "

In vitro, the variant dominantly inhibited AIRE; however, typical features of Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis and Ectodermal Dysplasia (APECED) were not seen in the subjects. Rather, early manifestation of autoimmunity appeared to be dependent on additional genetic factors. On a population level, diverse variants were identified in this region. Surprisingly, many likely pathogenic variants were seen disproportionately in Africans when compared to Europeans, reinforcing the importance of these variants in altering the immune repertoire. In light of these findings, we propose that R247C and other variants within the SAND-domain alter protein function in a dominant fashion and hold potential as drivers of autoimmunity.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a complex disorder having environmental and genetic causes. Existing techniques fail to detect milder forms of DDH in newborns leading to hip osteoarthritis in young adults. A sensitive, specific and cost effective test would allow identification of newborns that could be non-invasively corrected by the use of a Pavlik harness. Previously, we identified a 2.5 MB candidate region on human chromosome 3 by using linkage analysis of a 4 generation, 72 member family. Whole exome sequencing of the DNA of 4 severely affected members revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism variant, rs3732378 co-inherited by all 11 affected family members. This variant causes a threonine to methionine amino acid change in the coding sequence of the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor and is predicted to be harmful to the function of the protein To gain further insight into the function of this mutation we examined the effect of CX3CR1 ablation on the architecture of the mouse acetabulum and on the murine gait.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">The hips of 5 and 8 weeks old wild type and CX3CR1 KO mice were analyzed using micro-CT to measure acetabular diameter and ten additional dimensional parameters.

(3) At 8 weeks gait analysis of these same mice shows several metrics that are consistent with impairment in the KO but not the WT mice. These deficits are often seen in mice and humans who develop hip OA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The effect of CX3CR1 deletion on murine acetabular development provides suggestive evidence of a susceptibility inducing role of the CX3CR1 gene on DDH.</AbstractText> "

We characterized the dynamic repertoire of the chondrocyte miRNome and miRISC-associated miRNome by deep sequencing analysis of primary human chondrocytes. IL-1β treatment showed a modest effect on the expression profile of miRNAs in normal and osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes. We found a number of miRNAs that showed a wide range of sequence modifications including nucleotide additions and deletions at 5' and 3' ends; and nucleotide substitutions. miR-27b-3p showed the highest expression and miR-140-3p showed the highest number of sequence variations. AGO2 RIP-Seq analysis revealed the differential recruitment of a subset of expressed miRNAs and isoforms of miRNAs (isomiRs) to the miRISC in response to IL-1β, including miR-146a-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-27b-3p. Together, these results reveal a complex repertoire of miRNAs and isomiRs in primary human chondrocytes. Here, we also show the changes in miRNA composition of the miRISC in primary human chondrocytes in response to IL-1β treatment. These findings will provide an insight to the miRNA-mediated control of gene expression in the pathogenesis of OA.</AbstractText> "

On this evidence, CVID is potentially polygenic and epistatic although there are, as yet, no examples to support this hypothesis. We have identified a non-consanguineous family, who carry the C104R (c.310T&gt;C) mutation of the Transmembrane Activator Calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand Interactor (TACI, <i>TNFRSF13B</i>) gene. Variants in <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI are identified in up to 10% of CVID patients, and are associated with, but not solely causative of CVID. The proband is heterozygous for the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI C104R mutation and meets the Ameratunga <i>et al.</i> diagnostic criteria for CVID and the American College of Rheumatology criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her son has type 1 diabetes, arthritis, reduced IgG levels and IgA deficiency, but has not inherited the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI mutation. Her brother, homozygous for the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI mutation, is in good health despite profound hypogammaglobulinemia and mild cytopenias. We hypothesised that a second unidentified mutation contributed to the symptomatic phenotype of the proband and her son. Whole-exome sequencing of the family revealed a <i>de novo</i> nonsense mutation (T168fsX191) in the Transcription Factor 3 (<i>TCF3</i>) gene encoding the E2A transcription factors, present only in the proband and her son. We demonstrate mutations of <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI impair immunoglobulin isotype switching and antibody production predominantly via T-cell-independent signalling, while mutations of <i>TCF3</i> impair both T-cell-dependent and -independent pathways of B-cell activation and differentiation. We conclude that epistatic interactions between mutations of the <i>TNFRSF13B</i>/TACI and <i>TCF3</i> signalling networks lead to the severe CVID-like disorder and SLE in the proband.</AbstractText> "

This study investigated the role of miRNA in human mesangial cells (HMCs) stimulated with auto anti-dsDNA immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies. HMCs were treated with antibodies purified from active LN patients or non-specific IgG controls in the presence of normal serum. Aberrant miRNA was screened using high throughput sequencing. Anti-dsDNA IgG up-regulated 103 miRNAs and down-regulated 30 miRNAs. The miRNAs regulated genes in the cell cycle, catabolic processes, regulation of transcription and apoptosis signalling. miR-10a was highly abundant in HMCs but was specifically downregulated upon anti-dsDNA IgG induction. Interestingly, the expression of miR-10a in kidney biopsies from class III and IV LN patients (n = 26) was downregulated compared with cadaveric donor kidneys (n = 6). Functional studies highlighted the downstream regulator of miR-10a in the chemokine signalling and cell proliferation or apoptosis pathways. Luciferase assay confirmed for the first time that IL8 was a direct target of miR-10a in HMCs. In conclusion, anti-dsDNA IgG Ab down-regulated miR-10a expression in HMCs resulting in the induction of various target genes involved in HMC proliferation and chemokine expression.</AbstractText> "
"260";"29059182";"Profiling RNA-Seq at multiple resolutions markedly increases the number of causal eQTLs in autoimmune disease.";" <AbstractText>Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of risk loci for autoimmune disease, yet only a minority (~25%) share genetic effects with changes to gene expression (eQTLs) in immune cells. RNA-Seq based quantification at whole-gene resolution, where abundance is estimated by culminating expression of all transcripts or exons of the same gene, is likely to account for this observed lack of colocalisation as subtle isoform switches and expression variation in independent exons can be concealed. We performed integrative cis-eQTL analysis using association statistics from twenty autoimmune diseases (560 independent loci) and RNA-Seq data from 373 individuals of the Geuvadis cohort profiled at gene-, isoform-, exon-, junction-, and intron-level resolution in lymphoblastoid cell lines. After stringently testing for a shared causal variant using both the Joint Likelihood Mapping and Regulatory Trait Concordance frameworks, we found that gene-level quantification significantly underestimated the number of causal cis-eQTLs. Only 5.0-5.3% of loci were found to share a causal cis-eQTL at gene-level compared to 12.9-18.4% at exon-level and 9.6-10.5% at junction-level. More than a fifth of autoimmune loci shared an underlying causal variant in a single cell type by combining all five quantification types; a marked increase over current estimates of steady-state causal cis-eQTLs. Causal cis-eQTLs detected at different quantification types localised to discrete epigenetic annotations. We applied a linear mixed-effects model to distinguish cis-eQTLs modulating all expression elements of a gene from those where the signal is only evident in a subset of elements. Exon-level analysis detected disease-associated cis-eQTLs that subtly altered transcription globally across the target gene. We dissected in detail the genetic associations of systemic lupus erythematosus and functionally annotated the candidate genes. Many of the known and novel genes were concealed at gene-level (e.g. IKZF2, TYK2, LYST). Our findings are provided as a web resource.</AbstractText> "

Particularly, model-based approaches for clustering large-scale single cell transcriptomic data are still under-explored.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"">We developed DIMM-SC, a Dirichlet Mixture Model for clustering droplet-based Single Cell transcriptomic data. This approach explicitly models UMI count data from scRNA-Seq experiments and characterizes variations across different cell clusters via a Dirichlet mixture prior. We performed comprehensive simulations to evaluate DIMM-SC and compared it with existing clustering methods such as K-means, CellTree and Seurat. In addition, we analyzed public scRNA-Seq datasets with known cluster labels and in-house scRNA-Seq datasets from a study of systemic sclerosis with prior biological knowledge to benchmark and validate DIMM-SC. Both simulation studies and real data applications demonstrated that overall, DIMM-SC achieves substantially improved clustering accuracy and much lower clustering variability compared to other existing clustering methods. More importantly, as a model-based approach, DIMM-SC is able to quantify the clustering uncertainty for each single cell, facilitating rigorous statistical inference and biological interpretations, which are typically unavailable from existing clustering methods.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Availability and implementation"">DIMM-SC has been implemented in a user-friendly R package with a detailed tutorial available on www.pitt.edu/∼wec47/singlecell.html.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Contact"">wei.chen@chp.edu or hum@ccf.org.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Supplementary information"">Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

In this study, we used multiple approaches including genomic analysis to investigate and characterize the possible molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxicity of leflunomide in hepatic cells. We found that leflunomide caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activated an unfolded protein response, as evidenced by increased expression of related genes including CHOP and GADD34; and elevated protein levels of typical ER stress markers including CHOP, ATF-4, p-eIF2α, and spliced XBP1. The secretion of Gaussia luciferase was suppressed in cells treated with leflunomide in an ER stress reporter assay. Inhibition of ER stress with an ER stress inhibitor 4-phenylbutyrate, and knockdown of ATF-4 and CHOP genes partially protected cells upon leflunomide exposure. In addition, both genomic and biochemical analyses revealed that JNK and ERK1/2 of MAPK signaling pathways were activated, and both contributed to the leflunomide-induced cytotoxicity. Inhibiting JNK activation using a JNK inhibitor attenuated the ER stress and cytotoxicity of leflunomide, whereas inhibiting ERK1/2 using an ERK1/2 inhibitor or ERK1/2 siRNA increased the adverse effect caused by leflunomide, suggesting opposite roles for the two pathways. In summary, our data indicate that both ER stress and the activation of JNK and ERK1/2 contribute to leflunomide-induced cytotoxicity.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Published by Elsevier B.V.</CopyrightInformation> "

In vivo macrophage-driven acute inflammation models were utilized here to test whether the selective Ah receptor modulator 1-allyl-7-trifluoromethyl-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-methoxyphenol (SGA360) would reduce inflammation. Exposure to SGA360 was capable of significantly inhibiting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated endotoxic shock in a mouse model, both in terms of lethality and attenuating inflammatory signaling in tissues. Topical exposure to SGA360 was also able to mitigate joint edema in a monosodium urate (MSU) crystal gout mouse model. Inhibition was dependent on the expression of the high-affinity allelic AHR variant in both acute inflammation models. Upon peritoneal MSU crystal exposure SGA360 pretreatment inhibited neutrophil and macrophage migration into the peritoneum. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SGA360 attenuated the expression of numerous inflammatory genes and genes known to be directly regulated by AHR in thioglycolate-elicited primary peritoneal macrophages treated with LPS. In addition, expression of the high-affinity allelic AHR variant in cultured macrophages was necessary for SGA360-mediated repression of inflammatory gene expression. Mechanistic studies revealed that SGA360 failed to induce nuclear translocation of the AHR and actually enhanced cytoplasmic localization. LPS treatment of macrophages enhanced the occupancy of the AHR and p65 to the Ptgs2 promoter, whereas SGA360 attenuated occupancy. AHR ligand activity was detected in peritoneal exudates isolated from MSU-treated mice, thus suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity of SGA360 is mediated at least in part through AHR antagonism of endogenous agonist activity. These results underscore an important role of the AHR in participating in acute inflammatory signaling and warrants further investigations into possible clinical applications.</AbstractText> "

Although generally thought to be driven by a systemic autoimmune response, increasing evidence suggests that intrinsic changes in the muscle might also contribute to the pathogenesis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of novel genes that regulate gene transcription and translation. To determine the potential role of lncRNAs, we employed next generation sequencing to examine the transcriptome in muscle biopsies obtained from two histologically distinct patient populations, inclusion body myositis (IBM) and anti-Jo-1-associated myositis (Jo-1). 1287 mRNAs and 1068 mRNAs were differentially expressed in the muscle from Jo-1 and IBM patients, respectively. Pathway analysis showed the top canonical pathway in both Jo-1 and IBM was oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction. We identified 731 known and 325 novel lncRNAs in the muscles biopsies. Comparison with controls showed 55 and 46 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in IBM and Jo-1 myositis, respectively. Of these, 16 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in both IBM and Jo-1 myositis and included upregulated H19, lncMyoD and MALAT1. Given that these are known to regulate muscle proliferation and differentiation, we speculate that changes in lncRNAs might contribute to the phenotypic changes in Jo-1 and IBM myositis.</AbstractText> "

A further aim was to determine the immune signaling and genetic variation regulating TNFAIP3 expression in individual subjects.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Blood-derived macrophages from 50 AxSpA subjects and 30 healthy controls were assessed for TNFAIP3 expression. Cell lysates were also analyzed for NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and STAT3 phosphorylation, and supernatants for cytokine production. Coding and regulatory regions in the <i>TNFAIP3</i> gene and other auto-inflammation-implicated genes were sequenced by next-generation sequencing and variants identified.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Mean TNFAIP3 was significantly lower in spondyloarthritis macrophages than controls (<i>p</i> = 0.0085). Spondyloarthritis subject macrophages correspondingly produced more TNF-α in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS, <i>p</i> = 0.015). Subjects with the highest TNFAIP3 produced significantly less TNF-α in response to LPS (<i>p</i> = 0.0023). Within AxSpA subjects, those on TNF blockers or with shorter duration of disease expressed lower levels of TNFAIP3 (<i>p</i> = 0.0011 and 0.0030, respectively). TNFAIP3 expression correlated positively with phosphorylated IκBα, phosphorylated MAP kinases, and unstimulated phosphorylated STAT3, but negatively with LPS or TNF-α-stimulated fold induction of phosphorylated STAT3. Further, subjects with specific groups of variants within <i>TNFAIP3</i> displayed differences in TNFAIP3 (<i>p</i> = 0.03-0.004). Nominal pQTL associations with genetic variants outside <i>TNFAIP3</i> were identified.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results suggest that both immune functional and genetic variations contribute to the regulation of TNFAIP3 levels in individual subjects. Decreased expression of TNFAIP3 in AxSpA macrophages correlated with increased LPS-induced TNF-α, and thus, TNFAIP3 dysregulation may be a contributor to excessive inflammatory responses in spondyloarthritis subjects.</AbstractText> "

Captured and indexed libraries (QXT Target Enrichment System) prepared for 72 patients were sequenced as a multiplex of 16 samples on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer in 150bp paired-end mode. The cohort comprised 22 positive control DNA samples from patients with previously validated mutations in a variety of the genes; and 50 prospective samples from patients with suspected AID in whom previous Sanger based genetic screening had been non-diagnostic.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">VIP was sensitive and specific at detecting all the different types of known mutations in 22 positive controls, including gene deletion, small INDELS, and somatic mosaicism with allele fraction as low as 3%. Six/50 patients (12%) with unclassified AID had at least one class 5 (clearly pathogenic) variant; and 11/50 (22%) had at least one likely pathogenic variant (class 4). Overall, testing with VIP resulted in a firm or strongly suspected molecular diagnosis in 16/50 patients (32%).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The high diagnostic yield and accuracy of this comprehensive targeted gene panel validate the use of broad NGS-based testing for patients with suspected AID.</AbstractText> "

Its mutations have never been reported in human disease so far. The aim of this study was to associate the first mutation in <i>LAMA5</i> gene to a novel multisystem syndrome.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A detailed characterisation of a three-generation family, including clinical, biochemical, instrumental and morphological analysis, together with genetics and expression (WES and RNAseq) studies, was performed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The heterozygous <i>LAMA5</i> mutation c.9418G&gt;A (p.V3140M) was associated with skin anomalies, impaired scarring, night blindness, muscle weakness, osteoarthritis, joint and internal organs ligaments laxity, malabsorption syndrome and hypothyroidism. We demonstrated that the mutation alters the amount of LAMA5 peptides likely derived from protein cleavage and perturbs the activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal signalling, producing an unbalanced expression of Sonic hedgehog and <i>GLI1</i>, which are upregulated in cells from affected individuals, and of ECM proteins (COL1A1, MMP1 and MMP3), which are strongly inhibited. Studies carried out using human skin biopsies showed alteration of dermal papilla with a reduction of the germinative layer and an early arrest of hair follicle downgrowth.

However, a large proportion of patients need additional treatment with a biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) to adequately suppress their disease activity. A better understanding of genotypes could help to distinguish between patients with different pathogenic mechanisms. The aim of this study was therefore to identify networks of genes within DMARD-naive early RA patients associated with achieving sustained drug-free remission (sDFR) after initiating tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, or methotrexate therapy.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Samples were used from 60 patients from the U-Act-Early study who received tocilizumab plus methotrexate, tocilizumab, or methotrexate therapy, and who achieved sDFR (≥3 months in drug-free remission until the end of the study, n = 37) after therapy was tapered and subsequently stopped, or who were not able to discontinue the therapy as controls (n = 23). Whole blood samples were collected and ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from positive cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4<sup>+</sup>) and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells and analysed using high-throughput sequencing. Weighted gene co-expression network analyses were performed to identify clusters (i.e. modules) of differently expressed genes associated with achieving sDFR and which were subsequently used for pathway analyses.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Network analyses within CD4<sup>+</sup> cells identified two significant modules in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm and four modules in the tocilizumab and methotrexate arms, respectively (p ≤ 0.039). Important pathways in the module best correlating with achieving sDFR were in the tocilizumab plus methotrexate arm related to processes involved with transcription and translation; in the tocilizumab arm, pathways were related to migration of white blood cells and G-protein coupled receptors, and in the methotrexate arm pathways were involved with the response to a bacterial or biotic (i.e. biological material)-related stimulus. No relevant networks could be identified in the sequenced CD14<sup>+</sup> cells.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Within networks of co-expressed genes, several pathways were found related to achieving sDFR after initiating therapy with tocilizumab, methotrexate, or the combination. Between the three strategy arms, we identified different networks of predisposing genes which indicates that specific gene expression profiles, depending on the treatment strategy chosen, are associated with a higher chance of achieving sDFR.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01034137 .

"273";"28614801";"DNA methyltransferase 3b regulates articular cartilage homeostasis by altering metabolism.";" <AbstractText>Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis worldwide. It is a complex disease affecting the whole joint but is generally characterized by progressive degradation of articular cartilage. Recent genome-wide association screens have implicated distinct DNA methylation signatures in OA patients. We show that the de novo DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) 3b, but not Dnmt3a, is present in healthy murine and human articular chondrocytes and its expression decreases in OA mouse models and in chondrocytes from human OA patients. Targeted deletion of Dnmt3b in murine articular chondrocytes results in an early-onset and progressive postnatal OA-like pathology. RNA-Seq and methylC-Seq analyses of Dnmt3b loss-of-function chondrocytes show that cellular metabolic processes are affected. Specifically, TCA metabolites and mitochondrial respiration are elevated. Importantly, a chondroprotective effect was found following Dnmt3b gain of function in murine articular chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo. This study shows that Dnmt3b plays a significant role in regulating postnatal articular cartilage homeostasis. Cellular pathways regulated by Dnmt3b in chondrocytes may provide novel targets for therapeutic approaches to treat OA.</AbstractText> "
"274";"28598206";"A Novel In Vitro Human Granuloma Model of Sarcoidosis and Latent Tuberculosis Infection.";" <AbstractText>Many aspects of pathogenic granuloma formation are poorly understood, requiring new relevant laboratory models that represent the complexity (genetics and diversity) of human disease. To address this need, we developed an in vitro model of granuloma formation using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from patients with active sarcoidosis, latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI), or normal healthy control subjects. PBMCs were incubated for 7 days with uncoated polystyrene beads or beads coated with purified protein derivative (PPD) or human serum albumin. In response to PPD-coated beads, PBMCs from donors with sarcoidosis and LTBI formed robust multicellular aggregates resembling granulomas, displaying a typical T-helper cell type 1 immune response, as assessed by cytokine analyses. In contrast, minimal PBMC aggregation occurred when control PBMCs were incubated with PPD-coated beads, whereas the response to uncoated beads was negligible in all groups. Sarcoidosis PBMCs responded to human serum albumin-coated beads with modest cellular aggregation and inflammatory cytokine release. Whereas the granuloma-like aggregates formed in response to PPD-coated beads were similar for sarcoidosis and LTBI, molecular profiles differed significantly. mRNA expression patterns revealed distinct pathways engaged in early granuloma formation in sarcoidosis and LTBI, and they resemble molecular patterns reported in diseased human tissues. This novel in vitro human granuloma model is proposed as a tool to investigate mechanisms of early granuloma formation and for preclinical drug discovery research of human granulomatous disorders.

Although the carrier frequency of specific disease variants in the MEFV gene has been reported from isolated studies, a comprehensive view of variants in the Mediterranean region has not been possible due to paucity of data. The recent availability of whole-genome and whole-exome datasets prompted us to study the genetic epidemiology of MEFV variants in the region. We assembled data from 5 datasets encompassing whole-genome and whole-exome datasets for 2115 individuals from multiple subpopulations in the region and also created a compendium for MEFV genetic variants, which were further systematically annotated as per the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Our analysis points to significant differences in allele frequencies in the subpopulations, and the carrier frequency for MEFV genetic variants in the population to be about 8%. The MEFV gene appears to be under natural selection from our analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study and analysis of population epidemiology of MEFV gene variants in the Middle East and North African populations.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2017 John Wiley &amp; Sons A/S.

We conducted deep WGS on children with the polyarticular form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), using 2 independent cohorts to ascertain the sequencing fidelity. Genome wide SNP density analysis identified 18 SNP hotspots with comparison to the 1000 Genome Projects (1KGP) data. A subset of the genes adjacent to SNP hotspots showed statistically significant enrichment in immunological processes. Genes adjacent to indel hotspots were functionally related to G-protein coupled signaling pathways. Further analyses elucidated significantly more JIA SNPs with regulatory potential compared to 1KGP data. Furthermore, SNPs located within linkage disequibilium (LD) blocks containing previously identified JIA-associated SNPs demonstrated higher regulation potential compared to SNPs outside LD blocks. We also demonstrated enrichment of novel JIA variants in histone modification peaks and DNase hypersensitivity sites in B cells. This study greatly expands the number of genetic variants that may contribute to JIA and give us some clues into what may trigger this disease. To date, this study is the first deep WGS effort on children with JIA and provides useful genetic resources for research communities particularly in understanding JIA etiology.</AbstractText> "

We have established a cohort of women with RA and healthy women followed prospectively from a pre-pregnancy baseline. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that pregnancy-induced changes in gene expression among women with RA who improve during pregnancy (pregDAS<sub>improved</sub>) overlap substantially with changes observed among healthy women and differ from changes observed among women with RA who worsen during pregnancy (pregDAS<sub>worse</sub>).</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Global gene expression profiles were generated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from 11 women with RA and 5 healthy women before pregnancy (T0) and at the third trimester (T3). Among the women with RA, eight showed an improvement in disease activity by T3, whereas three worsened. Differential expression analysis was used to identify genes demonstrating significant changes in expression within each of the RA and healthy groups (T3 vs T0), as well as between the groups at each time point. Gene set enrichment was assessed in terms of Gene Ontology processes and protein networks.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 1296 genes were differentially expressed between T3 and T0 among the 8 pregDAS<sub>improved</sub> women, with 161 genes showing at least two-fold change (FC) in expression by T3. The majority (108 of 161 genes) were also differentially expressed among healthy women (q&lt;0.05, FC≥2). Additionally, a small cluster of genes demonstrated contrasting changes in expression between the pregDAS<sub>improved</sub> and pregDAS<sub>worse</sub> groups, all of which were inducible by type I interferon (IFN). These IFN-inducible genes were over-expressed at T3 compared to the T0 baseline among the pregDAS<sub>improved</sub> women.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">In our pilot RNA-seq dataset, increased pregnancy-induced expression of type I IFN-inducible genes was observed among women with RA who improved during pregnancy, but not among women who worsened. These findings warrant further investigation into expression of these genes in RA pregnancy and their potential role in modulation of disease activity. These results are nevertheless preliminary and should be interpreted with caution until replicated in a larger sample.</AbstractText> "

Using the Sanger method of DNA sequencing in 14 family members, we confirmed the presence of the mutation in 4 patients with SLE and in an asymptomatic 9-year-old girl. Complement levels were low in sera from patients with truncated C1r protein. Two siblings with SLE who were available for detailed evaluation exhibited strong type I interferon (IFN) inflammatory signatures despite their disease being clinically inactive at the time of sampling. The type I IFN transcriptional signature in the patients' blood correlated with disease expressivity, whereas the neutrophil signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was likely associated with disease severity. The female patient with SLE with the most severe phenotype presented with a stronger neutrophil signature, defined by enhanced NET formation and the presence of low-density granulocytes. Analysis of exome data for modifying alleles suggested enrichment of common SLE-associated variants in the more severely affected patients.

PTEN is a regulator of growth and homeostasis in immune system cells, although there are limited data describing immune dysregulation caused by <i>PTEN</i> mutations. We describe a case of PHTS syndrome caused by a de novo mutation in <i>PTEN</i> detected using a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel which was instigated for workup of cutaneous vasculitis.

Given that familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF) and RA-ILD frequently share the usual pattern of interstitial pneumonia and common environmental risk factors, we hypothesised that the two diseases might share additional risk factors, including FPF-linked genes. Our aim was to identify coding mutations of FPF-risk genes associated with RA-ILD.We used whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by restricted analysis of a discrete number of FPF-linked genes and performed a burden test to assess the excess number of mutations in RA-ILD patients compared to controls.Among the 101 RA-ILD patients included, 12 (11.9%) had 13 WES-identified heterozygous mutations in the <i>TERT</i>, <i>RTEL1</i>, <i>PARN</i> or <i>SFTPC</i> coding regions<i>.</i> The burden test, based on 81 RA-ILD patients and 1010 controls of European ancestry, revealed an excess of <i>TERT</i>, <i>RTEL1</i>, <i>PARN</i> or <i>SFTPC</i> mutations in RA-ILD patients (OR 3.17, 95% CI 1.53-6.12; p=9.45×10<sup>-4</sup>).

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play critical roles in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and influence the activity of NFκB, a key player in chronic inflammation. We aimed at investigating the association of TLR allelic variants with susceptibility and severity of RA through a systematic, high-throughput, analysis of TLR genes. All coding exons and flanking regions of nine members of the TLR family (TLR1-9) were analyzed in 66 patients with RA and 30 healthy controls by next generation sequencing. We focussed on three single allelic variants, N248S in TLR1, Q11L in TLR7 and M1V in TLR8 based on the allelic frequencies in both patient and control populations, the predicted impact on protein function and the novelty in RA research. Analysis of these selected variants in a larger cohort of 402 patients with RA and in 208 controls revealed no association with susceptibility. However, the M1V allele was associated with a lower need for disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (p=0.008) and biologic treatments (p=0.021). Functional studies showed that the M1V variant leads to a reduced production of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα, in response to TLR8 agonists. Thus, the presence of this variant confers a significant protective effect on disease severity. These results show for the first time the association between the M1V variant of TLR8 and reduced disease severity in RA, which could have prognostic value for these patients.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017.

Pharmacogenetic studies attempt to discover and estimate the contributions of genetic variants to the variability in response to a drug treatment. The task of identifying the genetic contribution is often complicated by response phenotypes that are based on imprecise or subjective clinical observations. Because the success of a pharmacogenetic study depends on the analysis of a heritable phenotype, it is important to identify phenotypes with a significant heritable component to ensure reliable and reproducible results in subsequent genetic association studies.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We retrospectively analyzed data collected from 436 rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with golimumab during the phase III GO-FURTHER study. We investigated the reliability of several potential response outcomes after golimumab treatment. Using whole-genome sequencing of the clinical trial cohort, we estimated the heritability of each potential outcome measure. We further performed a longitudinal analysis of the clinical data to estimate variability of outcome measures over time and the degree to which each response metric could be confounded by placebo response.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We determined that the high degree of within-patient variation over time makes a single follow-up visit insufficient to assess an individual patient's response to golimumab treatment. We found that different potential response outcomes had varying degrees of heritability and that averaging across multiple follow-up visits yielded higher heritability estimates than single follow-up estimates. Importantly, we found that the change in swollen and tender joint counts were the most heritable outcome metrics we tested; however, we showed that they are also more likely to be confounded by a placebo response than objective phenotypes like the change in C-reactive protein levels.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our rigorous approach to finding robust and heritable response phenotypes could be beneficial to all pharmacogenetic studies and may lead to more reliable and reproducible results.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""TRIAL REGISTRATION"">Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00973479 .

Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers a potential solution to dissect the heterogeneity of the disease and enables the study of similar cell types distant from the site of renal injury to identify novel biomarkers. We applied scRNA-seq to human renal and skin biopsy tissues and demonstrated that scRNA-seq can be performed on samples obtained during routine care. Chronicity index, IgG deposition, and quantity of proteinuria correlated with a transcriptomic-based score composed of IFN-inducible genes in renal tubular cells. Furthermore, analysis of cumulative expression profiles of single cell keratinocytes dissociated from nonlesional, non-sun-exposed skin of patients with lupus nephritis also revealed upregulation of IFN-inducible genes compared with keratinocytes isolated from healthy controls. This indicates the possible use of scRNA-seq analysis of skin biopsies as a biomarker of renal disease. These data support the potential utility of scRNA-seq to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis and pave the way for exploiting a readily accessible tissue to reflect injury in the kidney.</AbstractText> "

The first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTP I) is highly susceptible to development of OA due to repetitive mechanical stress during walking. We used whole exome sequencing to study genetic defect(s) predisposing to familial early-onset bilateral MTP I OA inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant rs41310883 (c.524C&gt;T, p.Thr175Met) in TUFT1 gene was found to co-segregate perfectly with MTP I OA. The role of TUFT1 and the relevance of the identified variant in pathogenesis of MTP I OA were further assessed using functional in vitro analyses. The variant reduced TUFT1 mRNA and tuftelin protein expression in HEK293 cells. ATDC5 cells overexpressing wild type (wt) or mutant TUFT1 were cultured in calcifying conditions and chondrogenic differentiation was found to be inhibited in both cell populations, as indicated by decreased marker gene expression when compared with the empty vector control cells. Also, the formation of cartilage nodules was diminished in both TUFT1 overexpressing ATDC5 cell populations. At the end of the culturing period the calcium content of the extracellular matrix was significantly increased in cells overexpressing mutant TUFT1 compared to cells overexpressing wt TUFT1 and control cells, while the proteoglycan content was reduced. These data imply that overexpression of TUFT1 in ATDC5 inhibits chondrogenic differentiation, and the identified variant may contribute to the pathogenesis of OA by increasing calcification and reducing amount of proteoglycans in the articular cartilage extracellular matrix thus making cartilage susceptible for degeneration and osteophyte formation.</AbstractText> "

We identified differentially methylated (using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array) and expressed (using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA-seq protocol) sites between cases and controls, and investigated the biological significance of this SARD signature using gene annotation databases. We recruited 13 seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, 19 systemic sclerosis, 12 systemic lupus erythematosus subjects, and 8 healthy controls. We identified 33 genes that were both differentially methylated and expressed (26 over- and 7 under-expressed) in SARD cases versus controls. The most highly overexpressed gene was CD1C (log fold change in expression = 1.85, adjusted P value = 0.009). In functional analysis (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis), the top network identified was lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry. The top canonical pathways included the mitochondrial L-carnitine shuttle pathway (P = 5E-03) and PTEN signaling (P = 8E-03). The top upstream regulator was HNF4A (P = 3E-05). This novel SARD signature contributes to ongoing work to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SARD and provides novel targets of interest.</AbstractText> "

Comparative analysis of the identified bacterial reads from serum samples found significant correlation of bacteria such as <i>Streptococcus</i> and <i>Haemophilus</i> spp. with the first and fourth episodes (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.9506) before treatment. In the first convalescent phase, the number of <i>Streptococcus</i> spp. was reduced remarkably (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001).

"288";"28339495";"MicroRNA expression profiles identify disease-specific alterations in systemic lupus erythematosus and primary Sjögren's syndrome.";" <AbstractText>The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their critical role in genetic control opened new avenues in understanding of various biological processes including immune cell lineage commitment, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. However, a given miRNA may have hundreds of different mRNA targets and a target might be regulated by multiple miRNAs, thus the characterisation of dysregulated miRNA expression profiles could give a better insight into the development of immunological disturbances in autoimmune diseases. The aim of our study was to examine the changes in miRNA expression profiles in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). Eight SLE patients, 8 pSS patients and 7 healthy subjects were enrolled in the investigation. MiRNAs were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and expression patterns were determined with Illumina next-generation sequencing technology. Since the immunopathogenesis of pSS and SLE encompasses pronounced B cell hyperactivity along with specific autoantibody production, we paid a special attention on the association between miRNA expression levels and altered peripheral B cell distribution. In SLE patients 135, while in pSS patients 26 miRNAs showed altered expression. Interestingly, the 25 miRNAs including miR-146a, miR-16 and miR-21, which were over-expressed in pSS patients, were found to be elevated in SLE group, as well. On the contrary, we observed the down-regulation of miR-150-5p, which is a novel and unique finding in pSS. Levels of several miRNAs over-expressed in SLE, were not changed in pSS, such as miR-148a-3p, miR-152, miR-155, miR-223, miR-224, miR-326 and miR-342. Expression levels of miR-223-5p, miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p and miR-342-3p, which miRNAs are potentially linked to B cell functions, showed associations with the B cell proportions within peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The observed differences in miRNA expression profiles and the better understanding of immune regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of SLE and pSS.</AbstractText> "
"289";"28333140";"Metabolic and molecular insights into an essential role of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.";" <AbstractText>Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a pleiotropic protein implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome, aging, cancer, coronary heart diseases, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, and sepsis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of NAMPT in these physiological and pathological processes are not fully understood. Here, we provide experimental evidence that a Nampt gene homozygous knockout (Nampt<sup>-/-</sup>) resulted in lethality at an early stage of mouse embryonic development and death within 5-10 days in adult mice accompanied by a 25.24±2.22% body weight loss, after the tamoxifen induction of Nampt<sup>F/F</sup> × Cre mice. These results substantiate that Nampt is an essential gene for life. In Nampt<sup>-/-</sup> mice versus Nampt<sup>+/+</sup> mice, biochemical assays indicated that liver and intestinal tissue NAD levels were decreased significantly; histological examination showed that mouse intestinal villi were atrophic and disrupted, and visceral fat was depleted; mass spectrometry detected unusual higher serum polyunsaturated fatty acid containing triglycerides. RNA-seq analyses of both mouse and human pediatric liver transcriptomes have convergently revealed that NAMPT is involved in key basic cellular functions such as transcription, translation, cell signaling, and fundamental metabolism. Notably, the expression of all eight enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were decreased significantly in the Nampt<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These findings prompt us to posit that adult Nampt<sup>-/-</sup> mouse lethality is a result of a short supply of ATP from compromised intestinal absorption of nutrients from digested food, which leads to the exhaustion of body fat stores.</AbstractText> "

Perturbed myocellular calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) homeostasis can exacerbate many of the factors proposed to mediate muscle degeneration in IBM, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation may plausibly be initiated in IBM by immune-mediated membrane damage and/or abnormally accumulating proteins, but no studies to date have investigated Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation in IBM patients. We first investigated protein expression via immunoblot in muscle biopsies from IBM, dermatomyositis, and non-myositis control patients, identifying several differentially expressed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulatory proteins in IBM. Next, we investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling transcriptome by RNA-seq, finding 54 of 183 (29.5%) genes from an unbiased list differentially expressed in IBM vs. controls. Using an established statistical approach to relate genes with causal transcription networks, Ca<sup>2+</sup> abundance was considered a significant upstream regulator of observed whole-transcriptome changes. Post-hoc analyses of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulatory mRNA and protein data indicated a lower protein to transcript ratio in IBM vs. controls, which we hypothesized may relate to increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent proteolysis and decreased protein translation. Supporting this hypothesis, we observed robust (4-fold) elevation in the autolytic activation of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated protease, calpain-1, as well as increased signaling for translational attenuation (eIF2a phosphorylation) downstream of the unfolded protein response. Finally, in IBM samples we observed mRNA and protein under-expression of calpain-3, the skeletal muscle-specific calpain, which broadly supports proper Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Together, these data provide novel insight into mechanisms by which intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulation is perturbed in IBM and offer evidence of pathological downstream effects.</AbstractText> "

We discovered two rare signals that strongly associate with osteoarthritis total hip replacement: a missense variant, c.1141G&gt;C (p.Asp369His), in the COMP gene (allelic frequency = 0.026%, P = 4.0 × 10<sup>-12</sup>, odds ratio (OR) = 16.7) and a frameshift mutation, rs532464664 (p.Val330Glyfs*106), in the CHADL gene that associates through a recessive mode of inheritance (homozygote frequency = 0.15%, P = 4.5 × 10<sup>-18</sup>, OR = 7.71). On average, c.1141G&gt;C heterozygotes and individuals homozygous for rs532464664 had their hip replacement operation 13.5 years and 4.9 years earlier than others (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0026), respectively. We show that the full-length CHADL transcript is expressed in cartilage. Furthermore, the premature stop codon introduced by the CHADL frameshift mutation results in nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant transcripts.</AbstractText> "

To gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, we studied known JIA genetic risk loci, the majority of which are located in non-coding regions, where transcription is regulated and coordinated on a genome-wide basis. We examined human neutrophils and CD4 primary T cells to identify genes and functional elements located within those risk loci.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We analyzed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, and previously published chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) data to characterize the chromatin landscapes within the known JIA-associated risk loci.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">In both neutrophils and primary CD4+ T cells, the majority of the JIA-associated linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks contained H3K27ac and/or H3K4me1 marks. These LD blocks were also binding sites for a small group of transcription factors, particularly in neutrophils. Furthermore, these regions showed abundant intronic and intergenic transcription in neutrophils. In neutrophils, none of the genes that were differentially expressed between untreated patients with JIA and healthy children were located within the JIA-risk LD blocks. In CD4+ T cells, multiple genes, including HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB2, TRAF1, and IRF1 were associated with the long-distance interacting regions within the LD regions as determined from ChIA-PET data.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">These findings suggest that genetic risk contributes to the aberrant transcriptional control observed in JIA.

Recent studies identified an association between a rare missense single nucleotide variant (SNV) in the ALDH16A1 gene and elevated serum uric acid levels and gout. The present study explores the mechanisms by which ALDH16A1 influences uric acid homeostasis in the kidney. We generated and validated a mouse line with global disruption of the Aldh16a1 gene through gene targeting and performed RNA-seq analyses in the kidney of wild-type (WT) and Aldh16a1 knockout (KO) mice, along with plasma metabolomics. We found that ALDH16A1 is expressed in proximal and distal convoluted tubule cells in the cortex of the kidney and in zone 3 hepatocytes. RNA-seq and gene ontology enrichment analyses showed that cellular lipid and lipid metabolic processes are up-regulated. Three transporters localized in the apical membrane of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney known to influence urate/uric acid homeostasis were found to be up-regulated (Abcc4, Slc16a9) or down-regulated (Slc17a3). An initial metabolomics analysis in plasma revealed an altered lipid profile in KO mice that is in agreement with our RNA-seq analysis. This is the first study demonstrating a functional role of ALDH16A1 in the kidney.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</CopyrightInformation> "
"295";"28235825";"Genome-Wide Screen Reveals <i>sec21</i> Mutants of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Are Methotrexate-Resistant.";" <AbstractText>Drug resistance is a consequence of how most modern medicines work. Drugs exert pressure on cells that causes death or the evolution of resistance. Indeed, highly specific drugs are rendered ineffective by a single DNA mutation. In this study, we apply the drug methotrexate, which is widely used in cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, and perform evolution experiments on Baker's yeast to ask the different ways in which cells become drug resistant. Because of the conserved nature of biological pathways between yeast and man, our results can inform how the same mechanism may operate to render human cells resistant to treatment. Exposure of cells to small molecules and drug therapies imposes a strong selective pressure. As a result, cells rapidly acquire mutations in order to survive. These include resistant variants of the drug target as well as those that modulate drug transport and detoxification. To systematically explore how cells acquire drug resistance in an unbiased manner, rapid cost-effective approaches are required. Methotrexate, as one of the first rationally designed anticancer drugs, has served as a prototypic example of such acquired resistance. Known methotrexate resistance mechanisms include mutations that increase expression of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) target as well as those that maintain function yet reduce the drug's binding affinity. Recent evidence suggests that target-independent, epistatic mutations can also result in resistance to methotrexate. Currently, however, the relative contribution of such unlinked resistance mutations is not well understood. To address this issue, we took advantage of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> as a model eukaryotic system that combined with whole-genome sequencing and a rapid screening methodology, allowed the identification of causative mutations that modulate resistance to methotrexate. We found a recurrent missense mutation in <i>SEC21</i> (orthologous to human COPG1), which we confirmed in 10 <i>de novo</i> methotrexate-resistant strains. This <i>sec21</i> allele (S96L) behaves as a recessive, gain-of-function allele, conferring methotrexate resistance that is abrogated by the presence of a wild-type copy of <i>SEC21</i> These observations indicate that the Sec21p/COPI transport complex has previously uncharacterized roles in modulating methotrexate stress.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 Wong et al.</CopyrightInformation> "

"298";"28209124";"RNA-seq and metabolomic analyses of Akt1-mediated muscle growth reveals regulation of regenerative pathways and changes in the muscle secretome.";" <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Skeletal muscle is a major regulator of systemic metabolism as it serves as the major site for glucose disposal and the main reservoir for amino acids. With aging, cachexia, starvation, and myositis, there is a preferential loss of fast glycolytic muscle fibers. We previously reported a mouse model in which a constitutively-active Akt transgene is induced to express in a subset of muscle groups leading to the hypertrophy of type IIb myofibers with an accompanying increase in strength. This muscle growth protects mice in various cardio-metabolic disease models, but little is known about the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms by which fast-twitch muscle impacts disease processes and regulates distant tissues. In the present study, poly (A) + tail mRNA-seq and non-targeted metabolomics were performed to characterize the transcriptome and metabolome of the hypertrophic gastrocnemius muscle from Akt1-transgenic mice.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Combined metabolomics and transcriptomic analyses revealed that Akt1-induced muscle growth mediated a metabolic shift involving reductions in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, but enhanced pentose phosphate pathway activation and increased branch chain amino acid accumulation. Pathway analysis for the 4,027 differentially expressed genes in muscle identified enriched signaling pathways involving growth, cell cycle regulation, and inflammation. Consistent with a regenerative transcriptional signature, the transgenic muscle tissue was found to be comprised of fibers with centralized nuclei that are positive for embryonic myosin heavy chain. Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed the presence of inflammatory cells associated with the regenerating fibers. Signal peptide prediction analysis revealed 240 differentially expressed in muscle transcripts that potentially encode secreted proteins. A number of these secreted factors have signaling properties that are consistent with the myogenic, metabolic and cardiovascular-protective properties that have previously been associated with type IIb muscle growth.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study provides the first extensive transcriptomic sequencing/metabolomics analysis for a model of fast-twitch myofiber growth. These data reveal that enhanced Akt signaling promotes the activation of pathways that are important for the production of proteins and nucleic acids. Numerous transcripts potentially encoding muscle secreted proteins were identified, indicating the importance of fast-twitch muscle in inter-tissue communication.</AbstractText> "

We evaluated and functionally characterized the fecal microbiome of IBD patients with or without peripheral SpA. Coupling the sorting of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-coated microbiota with 16<i>S</i> ribosomal RNA-based analysis (IgA-seq) revealed a selective enrichment in IgA-coated <i>Escherichia coli</i> in patients with Crohn's disease-associated SpA (CD-SpA) compared to CD alone. <i>E. coli</i> isolates from CD-SpA-derived IgA-coated bacteria were similar in genotype and phenotype to an adherent-invasive <i>E. coli</i> (AIEC) pathotype. In comparison to non-AIEC <i>E. coli</i>, colonization of germ-free mice with CD-SpA <i>E. coli</i> isolates induced T helper 17 cell (T<sub>H</sub>17) mucosal immunity, which required the virulence-associated metabolic enzyme propanediol dehydratase (<i>pduC</i>).

Recently, there has been great interest in the use of plant-derived compounds and supplements in managing the symptoms of OA. Arthrocen is a plant-based supplement consisting of avocado and soy unsaponifiable extracts in a 1 : 2 ratio. In an effort to unravel the potential mechanisms of its action on the cellular level, we utilized an <i>in vitro</i> assay to study its effects on cultured human chondrocytes. By pairing this assay with protein arrays on inflammatory markers, RNA-Seq with downstream pathway analysis, and lipidomics on eicosanoids, we were able to further define its action at the molecular level. Specifically, we found a role for Arthrocen in attenuating the inflammatory response both at the protein and mRNA level. Furthermore, we discovered that Arthrocen diminished prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in response to an inflammatory trigger. Additionally, unlike traditional COX-2 inhibitors, this response rather specifically attenuated PGE2 levels in the presence of inflammation and without lowering levels of other eicosanoids. This implies that Arthrocen could potentially bring about the reduced pain produced by COX-2 inhibitors without the known side effects of COX-2 inhibition.</AbstractText> "

Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyse the influence of clinical characteristics on strength and the change in strength over time. Whole exome sequencing was performed in a subset of patients.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Results"">. Among 50 patients followed for ⩾2 years, only 22 (44%) reached full strength with immunosuppressive therapy; even among those with full strength, 55% continued to have CK levels in excess of 500 IU/l and only three could be tapered off immunosuppressive therapy. Both univariate and multivariate analysis showed that patients who were older at disease onset were stronger at all time points (P &lt; 0.001) and improved faster (P &lt; 0.008) than younger patients; a history of statin exposure was not independently associated with the improvement rate. Younger patients were more likely to have refractory disease (P = 0.02) than older patients. Among eight refractory patients with DNA available for testing, whole exome sequencing did not reveal pathogenic mutations in known dystrophy genes. The risk of cancer was not increased in anti-HMGCR myositis patients compared with the general population.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""Conclusions"">Anti-HMGCR myositis is usually a chronic disease requiring long-term immunosuppression.

RNA-Seq has the potential to discover a more comprehensive set of eQTLs and illuminate the underlying molecular consequence. We examine the functional outcome of 39 variants associated with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) through the integration of GWAS and eQTL data from the TwinsUK microarray and RNA-Seq cohort in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We use conditional analysis and a Bayesian colocalisation method to provide evidence of a shared causal-variant, then compare the ability of each quantification type to detect disease relevant eQTLs and eGenes. We discovered the greatest frequency of candidate-causal eQTLs using exon-level RNA-Seq, and identified novel SLE susceptibility genes (e.g. NADSYN1 and TCF7) that were concealed using microarrays, including four non-coding RNAs. Many of these eQTLs were found to influence the expression of several genes, supporting the notion that risk haplotypes may harbour multiple functional effects. Novel SLE associated splicing events were identified in the T-reg restricted transcription factor, IKZF2, and other candidate genes (e.g. WDFY4) through asQTL mapping using the Geuvadis cohort. We have significantly increased our understanding of the genetic control of gene-expression in SLE by maximising the leverage of RNA-Seq and performing integrative GWAS-eQTL analysis against gene, exon, and splice-junction quantifications. We conclude that to better understand the true functional consequence of regulatory variants, quantification by RNA-Seq should be performed at the exon-level as a minimum, and run in parallel with gene and splice-junction level quantification.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© The Author 2017.

B-cell receptor (BCR) has a central role in B-cell development, activation, survival and apoptosis, and thus is a critical component of the regulation of both protective and autoreactive B cells. In this study, we applied multiplex PCR and Illumina high-throughput sequencing to study the composition and variation of the BCRs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SLE patients and healthy donors (NC). We found that SLE group displayed significantly shorter CDR3 average length (14.86±0.76aa vs 15.70±0.43aa), more arginine percentage of CDR3 amino acids (7.57±0.20% vs 7.32±0.19%) and poorer immunological diversity than the healthy ones. CDR3 sequence YGMDV present in all SLE samples may provide more information in generating more effective B-cell targeted diagnosis/therapies strategies.</AbstractText> "

Aberrant bone formation is a key feature of pathogenesis that can lead to ankylosis of the spine. Our objective is to determine, whether genes whose variants confer susceptibility to AS are expressed in bone progenitors like mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Since MSCs from bone marrow is difficult to obtain, we first examined, whether MSCs can be derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Dermal fibroblasts of two axSpA patients and one healthy control were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a Sendai virus vector encoding pluripotency genes. Pluripotency of iPSCs was examined by embryoid body formation and by testing for stem cell specific gene and protein expression using RT-PCR and immuno fluorescence. iPSCs were differentiated into MSCs by a TGFß inhibitor. MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry using lineage specific antibodies and by their capacity to develop into chondrocytes, adipocytes, and osteoblasts in lineage-specific medium. RNA-seq was applied to determine genome-wide gene expression patterns in MSCs, iPSCs, and blood. We show for the first time, that expression levels of several AS susceptibility genes (EDIL3, ANO6, HAPLN1, ANTXR2) involved in bone formation are significantly elevated in MSCs (2-15-fold; p ≤ 0.05) compared to blood or iPSCs and demonstrate that iPSC-derived MSCs can be differentiated into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. We conclude, MSCs generated from patient fibroblast-derived iPSC lines are useful tools for studying functional genomics of risk genes associated with bone formation in AS pathogenesis.</AbstractText> "

We therefore sought to test whether the RA lung microbiome contains distinct taxonomic features associated with local and/or systemic autoimmunity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing was utilized to compare the bacterial community composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) in patients with early, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD)-naïve RA, patients with lung sarcoidosis, and healthy control subjects. Samples were further assessed for the presence and levels of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (including fine specificities) in both BAL and serum.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The BAL microbiota of RA patients was significantly less diverse and abundant when compared to healthy controls, but similar to sarcoidosis patients. This distal airway dysbiosis was attributed to the reduced presence of several genus (i.e., Actynomyces and Burkhordelia) as well as reported periodontopathic taxa, including Treponema, Prevotella, and Porphyromonas. While multiple clades correlated with local and systemic levels of autoantibodies, the genus Pseudonocardia and various related OTUs were the only taxa overrepresented in RA BAL and correlated with higher disease activity and erosions.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Distal airway dysbiosis is present in untreated early RA and similar to that detected in sarcoidosis lung inflammation.

Renal biopsy is the gold standard when it comes to knowing whether a patient has lupus nephritis, and the degree of renal disease present. However, the biopsy has various complications, bleeding being the most common. Therefore, the development of alternative, non-invasive diagnostic tests for kidney disease in patients with SLE is a priority. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are differentially expressed in various tissues, and changes in their expression have been associated with several pathological processes. The aim of this study was to identify changes in the abundance of miRNAs in plasma samples from patients with lupus nephritis that could potentially allow the diagnosis of renal damage in SLE patients. This is an observational case-control cross-sectional study, in which we characterized the differential abundance profiles of miRNAs among patients with different degrees of lupus compared with SLE patients without renal involvement and healthy control individuals. We found 89 miRNAs with changes in their abundance between lupus nephritis patients and healthy controls, and 17 miRNAs that showed significant variations between SLE patients with or without renal involvement. Validation for qPCR of a group of miRNAs on additional samples from lupus patients with or without nephritis, and from healthy individuals, showed that five miRNAs presented an average detection sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 70.3%, a positive predictive value of 82.5%, a negative predictive value of 96% and a diagnosis efficiency of 87.9%. These results strongly suggest that miR-221-5p, miR-380-3p, miR-556-5p, miR-758-3p and miR-3074-3p are potential diagnostic biomarkers of lupus nephritis in patients with SLE. The observed differential pattern of miRNA abundance may have functional implications in the pathophysiology of SLE renal damage.</AbstractText> "

Emerging high throughput sequencing technologies have been proved to be a useful platform to understand the complex and dynamic disease processes. SLE patients categorised based on autoantibody specificities are reported to have differential immuno-regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq analysis to identify transcriptomics of SLE patients with distinguished autoantibody specificities. The SLE patients were segregated into three subsets based on the type of autoantibodies present in their sera (anti-dsDNA+ group with anti-dsDNA autoantibody alone; anti-ENA+ group having autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) only, and anti-dsDNA+ENA+ group having autoantibodies to both dsDNA and ENA). Global transcriptome profiling for each SLE patients subsets was performed using Illumina® Hiseq-2000 platform. The biological relevance of dysregulated transcripts in each SLE subsets was assessed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) software. We observed that dysregulation in the transcriptome expression pattern was clearly distinct in each SLE patients subsets. IPA analysis of transcripts uniquely expressed in different SLE groups revealed specific biological pathways to be affected in each SLE subsets. Multiple cytokine signaling pathways were specifically dysregulated in anti-dsDNA+ patients whereas Interferon signaling was predominantly dysregulated in anti-ENA+ patients. In anti-dsDNA+ENA+ patients regulation of actin based motility by Rho pathway was significantly affected. The granulocyte gene signature was a common feature to all SLE subsets; however, anti-dsDNA+ group showed relatively predominant expression of these genes. Dysregulation of Plasma cell related transcripts were higher in anti-dsDNA+ and anti-ENA+ patients as compared to anti-dsDNA+ ENA+. Association of specific canonical pathways with the uniquely expressed transcripts in each SLE subgroup indicates that specific immunological disease mechanisms are operative in distinct SLE patients' subsets. This 'sub-grouping' approach could further be useful for clinical evaluation of SLE patients and devising targeted therapeutics.</AbstractText> "

Two variants, the SQSTM1 p.G194R and the VCP p.R159C, were significantly overrepresented in this sIBM cohort compared with controls. Five of these variants had been previously reported in patients with degenerative diseases. The messenger RNA levels of major histocompatibility complex genes were upregulated, this elevation being more pronounced in SQSTM1 patient group. We report for the first time potentially pathogenic SQSTM1 variants and expand the spectrum of VCP variants in sIBM. These data suggest that defects in neurodegenerative pathways may confer genetic susceptibility to sIBM and reinforce the mechanistic overlap in these neurodegenerative disorders.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

"325";"27733572";"Neutrophil biomarkers predict response to therapy with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis.";" <AbstractText>Neutrophils are implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the mechanisms regulating their activation are largely unknown. RA is a heterogeneous disease, and whereas many patients show clinical improvement during TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy, a significant proportion fails to respond. In vitro activation of neutrophils with agents, including TNF, results in rapid and selective changes in gene expression, but how neutrophils contribute to TNF signaling in RA and whether TNFi sensitivity involves differential neutrophil responses are unknown. With the use of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), we analyzed blood neutrophils from 20 RA patients, pre-TNFi therapy, to identify biomarkers of response, measured by a decrease in disease activity score based on 28 joint count (DAS28), 12 wk post-therapy. Biomarkers were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of blood neutrophils from 2 further independent cohorts of RA patients: 16 pre-TNFi and 16 predisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Twenty-three neutrophil transcripts predicted a 12-wk response to TNFi: 10 (IFN-regulated) genes predicting a European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response and 13 different genes [neutrophil granule protein (NGP) genes] predicting a nonresponse. Statistical analysis indicated a predictive sensitivity and specificity of each gene in the panel of &gt;80%, with some 100% specific. A combination of 3 genes [<i>cytidine monophosphate kinase 2</i> (<i>CMPK2</i>), <i>IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1B</i> (<i>IFIT1B</i>), and <i>RNASE3</i>] had the greatest predictive power [area under the curve (AUC) 0.94]. No correlation was found for a response to DMARDs. We conclude that this panel of genes is selective for predicting a response to TNFi and is not a surrogate marker for disease improvement. We also show that in RA, there is great plasticity in neutrophil phenotype, with circulating cells expressing genes normally only expressed in more immature cells.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Society for Leukocyte Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"326";"27601627";"Low-density granulocytes: functionally distinct, immature neutrophils in rheumatoid arthritis with altered properties and defective TNF signalling.";" <AbstractText>Our aim was to determine whether rheumatoid arthritis (RA) low-density granulocytes (LDGs) are functionally different from RA neutrophils. LDGs from 32 RA patients were characterized using flow cytometry and quantitative PCR (qPCR). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was carried out on paired RA LDGs and neutrophils (n = 4) and validated using qPCR. Functional assays included chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell-cycle analysis, apoptosis, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)osis, and measurement of cytokine production (n ≥ 5 paired RA LDGs/neutrophils). RA LDGs had a substantially altered transcriptome, expressing &gt;5000 genes at significantly different levels compared with RA neutrophils, including elevated levels of transcripts for granule proteins [including elastase and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] and cell-cycle genes [including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, CDK4, and CDK6]. Approximately 1% of RA LDGs stained positive for the G2/S phase of the cell cycle. RA LDGs had a significantly lower constitutive rate of apoptosis compared with RA neutrophils and did not respond to TNF-α in culture. Expression of transcripts for cytokines and cytokine receptors was lower in RA LDGs. NET formation was lower in LDGs in response to PMA compared with RA neutrophils. Chemotaxis and phagocytosis was lower in RA LDGs compared with neutrophils. RA LDGs produced significantly lower amounts of ROS in response to fMLP following priming with TNF-α. Expression of TNFR1 and -2 mRNA and protein was significantly lower in LDGs. We conclude that RA LDGS are functionally different from RA neutrophils, representing an immature neutrophil population within peripheral blood. Their enhanced survival properties and decreased TNF signaling are likely to have important consequences for disease pathology and response to therapy.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© Society for Leukocyte Biology.</CopyrightInformation> "

Infective pericarditis has been described as a complication of these treatments with possible life-threatening consequences. In similar cases cultures may isolate multiple opportunistic bacteria from the pericardial fluid without specific identification of the responsible germ, representing a problem for targeted antibiotic therapy. We present a case of acute pericarditis evolving in pericardial constriction and cardiac tamponade in a patient treated with adalimumab for psoriatic arthritis overlapping with recurrent polychondritis. Next-generation sequencing allowed the identification of a common oral pathogen as the aetiological agent confirming its role in the identification of species that can be overlooked by common microbiological techniques. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>2016 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.</CopyrightInformation> "

This study evaluated 69 significant expressed profiles of microRNA (miRNA) in the articular cartilage and subchondral bone after ESWT. There were 118 target genes identified for miRNAs of interest in articular cartilage and 214 target genes in subchondral bone by next generation sequencing (NGS). In principal component analysis (PCA), the relationships of miRNA expression in bone and cartilage were improved after ESWT. Global functional annotation showed that predicted targets were involved in cartilage development, inflammatory and immune response, ion binding, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, cell cycle, transcription and translation, gene expression, NTP binding, signal transduction, collagen fibril organization, apoptotic process, chondrocyte differentiation, cell differentiation, bone development as well as cell proliferation. The miRNAs profile and the target genes were comprehensively surveyed and compared in articular cartilage and subchondral bone of early OA knee before and after ESWT. Our study represents the direct assessment to date of miRNA expression profiling in early OA articular cartilage and subchondral bone. The results provide insights that could contribute to the development of new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for OA changes and the treatment with ESWT.</AbstractText> "

Results of recent studies suggest that epigenetic dysregulation impairs normal angiogenesis and can result in abnormal patterns of blood vessel growth. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) control endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and regulate EC migration. Specifically, HDAC-5 appears to be antiangiogenic. This study was undertaken to test whether HDAC-5 contributes to impaired angiogenesis in SSc by repressing proangiogenic factors in ECs.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Dermal ECs were isolated from patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc and healthy controls. Angiogenesis was assessed using an in vitro Matrigel tube formation assay. An assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) was performed to assess and localize the genome-wide effects of HDAC5 knockdown on chromatin accessibility.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The expression of HDAC5 was significantly increased in ECs from patients with SSc compared to healthy control ECs. Silencing of HDAC5 in SSc ECs restored normal angiogenesis. HDAC5 knockdown followed by ATAC-seq assay in SSc ECs identified key HDAC5-regulated genes involved in angiogenesis and fibrosis, such as CYR61, PVRL2, and FSTL1. Simultaneous knockdown of HDAC5 in conjunction with either CYR61, PVRL2, or FSTL1 inhibited angiogenesis in SSc ECs. Conversely, overexpression of these genes individually led to an increase in tube formation as assessed by Matrigel assay, suggesting that these genes play functional roles in the impairment of angiogenesis in SSc.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Several novel HDAC5-regulated target genes associated with impaired angiogenesis were identified in SSc ECs by ATAC-seq.

"332";"27421018";"Exome sequencing in Thai patients with familial obesity.";" <AbstractText>Obesity is a major worldwide health issue, with increasing prevalence in adults and children from developed and developing countries. Obesity causes several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, osteoarthritis, hypertension, stroke, type II diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and several types of cancer. Previous genome-wide association studies have identified several genes associated with obesity, including LEP, LEPR, POMC, PCSK1, FTO, MC3R, MC4R, GNPDA2, TMEM18, QPCTL/GIPR, BDNF, ETV5, MAP2K5/SKOR1, SEC16B, SIM1, and TNKS/MSRA. However, most of these variants are found in the intronic or intergenic regions, making it difficult to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Therefore, in this study, we performed a whole exome sequencing of the protein-coding regions in the total genome (exome) of two obese and one normal subject belonging to the same Thai family to identify the genes responsible for obesity. We identified 709 functional variants that were differentially expressed between obese and normal subjects; of these, 65 were predicted to be deleterious to protein structure or function. The minor allele frequency of 14 of these genes (ALOX5AP, COL9A2, DEFB126, GDPD4, HCRTR1, MLL3, OPLAH, OR4C45, PRIM2, RXFP2, TIGD6, TRPM8, USP49, and ZNF596) was low, indicating causal variants that could be associated with complex traits or diseases. Genotyping revealed HCRTR1, COL9A2, and TRPM8 to be associated with the regulation of feeding behavior and energy expenditure. These genes constituted a network of pathways, including lipid metabolism, signaling transduction, immune, membrane transport, and gene regulation pathways, and seemed to play important roles in obesity. </AbstractText> "

Two weeks after the first dose, he experienced anorexia and fatigue, and suffered from progressive, severe dyspnea and muscle weakness. We diagnosed him with myocarditis, myositis, and myasthenic crisis induced by nivolumab. We commenced steroid therapy, immune absorption therapy, plasma exchange therapy, and i.v. immunoglobulin therapy, and succeeded in saving his life. Because his serum level of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies in a sample collected before nivolumab treatment were positive and were elevated significantly after nivolumab, we suspected that nivolumab triggered a severe autoimmune response, which progressed subclinical myasthenia gravis to myasthenic crisis. We carried out T cell receptor repertoire analysis using next-generation sequencing technologies and identified infiltration of clonally expanded T cell populations in the skeletal muscle after nivolumab treatment, implying a very strong T cell immune response against muscular cells. To avoid severe immune-related adverse events, the exclusion of patients with subclinical autoimmune disease is very important for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 The Authors.

TRAP deficiency in PDCs leads to increased IFNα production, providing at least a partial explanation for how ACP5 mutations cause lupus in the context of spondyloenchondrodysplasia. Detection of ACP5 missense variants in a lupus cohort suggests that impaired TRAP functioning may increase susceptibility to sporadic lupus.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

To permit early diagnosis and treatment of OA, a high resolution mechanistic understanding of human chondrocytes in normal and diseased states is necessary. In this study, we assessed the biological effects of OA-related changes in the synovial microenvironment on chondrocytes embedded within anatomically intact cartilage from joints with different pathological grades by next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We determined the transcriptome of primary articular chondrocytes derived from anatomically unaffected knees and ankles, as well as from joints affected by OA. The GALAXY bioinformatics platform was used to facilitate biological interpretations. Comparisons of patient samples by k-means, hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses together reveal that primary chondrocytes exhibit OA grade-related differences in gene expression, including genes involved in cell-adhesion, ECM production and immune response. We conclude that diseased synovial microenvironments in joints with different histopathological OA grades directly alter gene expression in chondrocytes. One ramification of this finding is that anatomically intact cartilage from OA joints is not an ideal source of healthy chondrocytes, nor should these specimens be used to generate a normal baseline for the molecular characterization of diseased joints. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016.

Early responses to known or novel autoantigens likely drive the eventual production of pathogenic autoimmunity. Importantly, the presence of disease-specific autoantibodies can identify individuals who are at high risk of developing RA but who do not currently have arthritis. The goal of the current study was to characterize plasmablasts from individuals at risk of developing RA.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We investigated antibody-secreting plasmablasts derived from a well-characterized cohort of individuals who were at risk of developing RA, based on RA-related serum autoantibody positivity, as compared to patients with early (&lt;1 year) seropositive RA as well as healthy control subjects. The plasmablast antibody repertoires of at-risk subjects were analyzed using DNA barcode-based methods with paired heavy- and light-chain gene sequencing. Cells were single-cell sorted, the cell- and plate-specific DNA barcodes were sequentially added, and next-generation sequencing was performed.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Total plasmablast levels were similar in the antibody-positive (1%) and control (0.4-1.6%) groups. However, increased frequencies of IgA+ versus IgG+ plasmablasts were observed in the antibody-positive group (39% IgA+ and 37% IgG+) as compared to other groups (1-9% IgA+ and 71-87% IgG+). Paired antibody sequences from antibody-positive subjects revealed cross-isotype clonal families and similar sequence characteristics in the IgA and IgG plasmablast repertoires. Antibody-positive individuals also demonstrated elevated serum levels of IgA isotype anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide 3 antibodies.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The IgA plasmablast dominance in these antibody-positive individuals suggests that a subset of RA-related autoantibodies may arise from mucosal immune responses and may be involved in early disease pathogenesis in individuals who are at risk of developing RA.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "

However, methods that probe the status of the epigenome are lacking. Here, the framework for applying the Assay for Transposase Accessible Sequencing (ATAC-seq) to biobanked specimens is described and was used to examine the accessibility landscape of naïve B cells from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients undergoing disease flares. An SLE specific chromatin accessibility signature was identified. Changes in accessibility occurred at loci surrounding genes involved in B cell activation and contained motifs for transcription factors that regulate B cell activation and differentiation. These data provide evidence for an altered epigenetic programming in SLE B cells and identify loci and transcription factor networks that potentially impact disease. The ability to determine the chromatin accessibility landscape and identify cis-regulatory elements has broad application to studies using biorepositories and offers significant advantages to improve the molecular information obtained from biobanked samples.</AbstractText> "

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is important for B cell development, Fc receptor signaling, and macrophage polarization. In this study, we investigated the effects of a novel, highly selective and potent BTK inhibitor, BI-BTK-1, in an inducible model of LN in which mice receive nephrotoxic serum (NTS) containing anti-glomerular antibodies. Mice were treated once daily with vehicle alone or BI-BTK-1, either prophylactically or therapeutically. When compared with control treated mice, NTS-challenged mice treated prophylactically with BI-BTK-1 exhibited significantly attenuated kidney disease, which was dose dependent. BI-BTK-1 treatment resulted in decreased infiltrating IBA-1+ cells, as well as C3 deposition within the kidney. RT-PCR on whole kidney RNA and serum profiling indicated that BTK inhibition significantly decreased levels of LN-relevant inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Renal RNA expression profiling by RNA-seq revealed that BI-BTK-1 dramatically modulated pathways related to inflammation and glomerular injury. Importantly, when administered therapeutically, BI-BTK-1 reversed established proteinuria and improved renal histopathology. Our results highlight the important role for BTK in the pathogenesis of immune complex-mediated nephritis, and BTK inhibition as a promising therapeutic target for LN.</AbstractText> "
"339";"27183593";"RBP-J-Regulated miR-182 Promotes TNF-α-Induced Osteoclastogenesis.";" <AbstractText>Increased osteoclastogenesis is responsible for osteolysis, which is a severe consequence of inflammatory diseases associated with bone destruction, such as rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. The mechanisms that limit osteoclastogenesis under inflammatory conditions are largely unknown. We previously identified transcription factor RBP-J as a key negative regulator that restrains TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone resorption. In this study, we tested whether RBP-J suppresses inflammatory osteoclastogenesis by regulating the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) important for this process. Using high-throughput sequencing of miRNAs, we obtained the first, to our knowledge, genome-wide profile of miRNA expression induced by TNF-α in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages/osteoclast precursors during inflammatory osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, we identified miR-182 as a novel miRNA that promotes inflammatory osteoclastogenesis driven by TNF-α and whose expression is suppressed by RBP-J. Downregulation of miR-182 dramatically suppressed the enhanced osteoclastogenesis program induced by TNF-α in RBP-J-deficient cells. Complementary loss- and gain-of-function approaches showed that miR-182 is a positive regulator of osteoclastogenic transcription factors NFATc1 and B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1. Moreover, we identified that direct miR-182 targets, Foxo3 and Maml1, play important inhibitory roles in TNF-α-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Thus, RBP-J-regulated miR-182 promotes TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis via inhibition of Foxo3 and Maml1. Suppression of miR-182 by RBP-J serves as an important mechanism that restrains TNF-α-induced osteoclastogenesis. Our results provide a novel miRNA-mediated mechanism by which RBP-J inhibits osteoclastogenesis and suggest that targeting of the newly described RBP-J-miR-182-Foxo3/Maml1 axis may represent an effective therapeutic approach to suppress inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2016 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</CopyrightInformation> "

We encountered a 13-year-old Japanese female initially diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia on the basis of clinical manifestations of severe hypercholesterolemia (initial LDL cholesterol=609 mg/dl at the age of one) and systemic intertriginous xanthomas with histories of recurrent self-limiting episodes of fever and arthritis. Both her phenotypes seemed to co-segregate in a recessive manner. We performed WES on this patient, who was considered a proband. Among 206,430 variants found in this individual, we found 18,220 nonsense, missense, or splice site variants, of which 3,087 were rare (minor allele frequency ≤ 0.01 or not reported) in 1000 Genome (Asian population). Filtering by assuming a recessive pattern of inheritance with the use of an in silico annotation prediction tool, we successfully narrowed down the candidates to the compound heterozygous mutations in the ABCG5 gene (c.1256G＞A or p.Arg419His/c.1763-1G＞A [splice acceptor site]) and to the double-compound heterozygous mutations in the MEFV gene (c.329T＞C/C or p.Leu110Pro/c.442G＞C/C or p.Glu148Val). The patient was genetically diagnosed with sitosterolemia and familial Mediterranean fever using WES for the first time. Such a comprehensive approach is useful for identifying causative mutations for multiple unrelated inheritable diseases. </AbstractText> "

Murine AQP9 protein expression has been verified in liver, skin, epididymis, epidermis and neuronal cells using knockout mice. Further expression sites have been reported in humans. We aimed to verify AQP9 expression in a large set of human normal organs, different cancer types, rheumatoid arthritis synovial biopsies as well as in cell lines and primary cells. Combining standardized immunohistochemistry with high-throughput mRNA sequencing, we found that AQP9 expression in normal tissues was limited, with high membranous expression only in hepatocytes. In cancer tissues, AQP9 expression was mainly found in hepatocellular carcinomas, suggesting no general contribution of AQP9 to carcinogenesis. AQP9 expression in a subset of rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue samples was affected by Humira, thereby supporting a suggested role of TNFα in AQP9 regulation in this disease. Among cell lines and primary cells, LP-1 myeloma cells expressed high levels of AQP9, whereas low expression was observed in a few other lymphoid cell lines. AQP9 mRNA and protein expression was absent in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Overall, AQP9 expression in human tissues appears to be more selective than in mice.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2016 The Histochemical Society.</CopyrightInformation> "

H3K4me3 is a canonical chromatin mark of active transcription. Recent studies have suggested that H3K4me3 breadth has an important regulatory role in cell identity. This project examined H3K4me3 breadth at transcription start sites (TSS) in primary monocytes and its association with differential gene transcription in SLE.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Integrative analysis was applied to chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated from primary monocytes as well as genomic data available in public repositories. Four distinctive H3K4me3 patterns of ChIP-seq peaks were identified at 8399 TSSs. Narrow peaks were highly enriched with genes related to housekeeping functions. The broader peaks with extended H3K4me3 immediately upstream and/or downstream of TSS were associated with immune response genes. Many TSSs had downstream H3K4me3 extended to ~650 bp, where the transition of H3K4me3 to H3K36me3, a transcriptional elongation mark, is often found. The H3K4me3 pattern was strongly associated with transcription in SLE. Genes with narrow peaks were less likely (OR = 0.14, p = 2 × 10(-4)) while genes with extended downstream H3K4me3 were more likely (OR = 2.37, p = 1 × 10(-11)) to be overexpressed in SLE. Of the genes significantly overexpressed in SLE, 78.8 % had increased downstream H3K4me3 while only 47.1 % had increased upstream H3K4me3. Gene transcription sensitively and consistently responded to H3K4me3 change downstream of TSSs. Every 1 % increase of H3K4me3 in this region leads to ~1.5 % average increase of transcription.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">We identified the immediate TSS downstream nucleosome as a crucial regulator responsible for transcription changes in SLE. This study applied a unique method to study the effect of H3K4me3 breadth on diseases and revealed new insights about epigenetic modifications in SLE, which could lead to novel treatments.</AbstractText> "

Treg cell function was measured in suppressive assays. The T cell receptor β chain (TRB) was amplified by multiplex polymerase chain reaction and next-generation sequencing was performed, with amplicons sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq platform. Data were analyzed using ImmunoSEQ, International ImMunoGeneTics system, and the Immunoglobulin Analysis Tools.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Compared to findings in controls, the JIA peripheral blood Treg cell repertoire was restricted, and clonotypic expansions were found in both blood and synovial fluid Treg cells. Skewed usage and pairing of TRB variable and joining genes, including overuse of gene segments that have been associated with other autoimmune conditions, was observed. JIA patients shared a substantial portion of synovial fluid Treg cell clonotypes that were private to JIA and not identified in Lyme arthritis.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">We identified restriction and clonotypic expansions in the JIA Treg cell repertoire with sharing of Treg cell clonotypes across patients.

CD154 up-regulation was measured as a marker of antigen-specific activation, and anti-HLA-DR-blocking experiments confirmed HLA restriction. Cytokine production was measured using a Luminex technique. Direct peptide-binding assays using HLA-DRB1*10:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:01 monomeric proteins were performed. The T cell receptor (TCR) β-chain of CD154-enriched antigen-specific T cells was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A novel Cit-CII peptide was identified based on its ability to activate CD4+ T cells from HLA-DRB1*10:01-positive individuals. When stimulated in vitro, Cit-CII autoreactive T cells produced proinflammatory cytokines. Cit-CII(311-325) bound (with low affinity) to HLA-DRB1*10:01 but not to HLA-DRB1*04:01, while the native form was unable to bind either protein.

SLE activity is experimentally assessed by several blood tests, including gene expression profiling of heterogeneous populations of cells in peripheral blood. To better understand the contribution of different cell types in SLE pathogenesis, we applied the two methods in cell-type-specific differential expression analysis, csSAM and DSection, to identify cell-type-specific gene expression differences in heterogeneous gene expression measures obtained using RNA-seq technology. We identified B-cell-, monocyte-, and neutrophil-specific gene expression differences. Immunoglobulin-coding gene expression was altered in B-cells, while a ribosomal signature was prominent in monocytes. On the contrary, genes differentially expressed in the heterogeneous mixture of cells did not show any functional enrichment. Our results identify antigen binding and structural constituents of ribosomes as functions altered by B-cell- and monocyte-specific gene expression differences, respectively. Finally, these results position both csSAM and DSection methods as viable techniques for cell-type-specific differential expression analysis, which may help uncover pathogenic, cell-type-specific processes in SLE. </AbstractText> "

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases. The potential roles of miRNA-regulated genes in RA pathogenesis have greatly aroused the interest of clinicians and researchers in recent years. In the current study, RA-related miRNAs records were obtained from PubMed through conditional literature retrieval. After analyzing the selected records, miRNA targeted genes were predicted. We identified 14 RA-associated miRNAs, and their sub-analysis in 5 microarray or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets was performed. The microarray and RNA-seq data of RA were also downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA), analyzed, and annotated. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified a series of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing studies on RA and the controls. The RA-related gene expression profile was thus obtained and the expression of miRNA-regulated genes was analyzed. After functional annotation analysis, we found GO molecular function (MF) terms significantly enriched in calcium ion binding (GO: 0005509). Moreover, some novel dysregulated target genes were identified in RA through integrated analysis of miRNA/mRNA expression. The result revealed that the expression of a number of genes, including ROR2, ABI3BP, SMOC2, etc., was not only affected by dysregulated miRNAs, but also altered in RA. Our findings indicate that there is a close association between negatively correlated mRNA/miRNA pairs and RA. These findings may be applied to identify genetic markers for RA diagnosis and treatment in the future. </AbstractText> "

Although expanded CD4(+) T cell clones (ECs) has already been confirmed, the detailed characteristics of ECs have not been elucidated in RA. Using combination of a single-cell analysis and next-generation sequencing (NGS) in TCR repertoire analysis, we here revealed the detailed nature of ECs by examining peripheral blood (PB) from 5 RA patients and synovium from 1 RA patient. When we intensively investigated the single-cell transcriptome of the most expanded clones in memory CD4(+) T cells (memory-mECs) in RA-PB, senescence-related transcripts were up-regulated, indicating circulating ECs were constantly stimulated. Tracking of the transcriptome shift within the same memory-mECs between PB and the synovium revealed the augmentations in senescence-related gene expression and the up-regulation of synovium-homing chemokine receptors in the synovium. Our in-depth characterization of ECs in RA successfully demonstrated the presence of the specific immunological selection pressure, which determines the phenotype of ECs. Moreover, transcriptome tracking added novel aspects to the underlying sequential immune processes. Our approach may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of RA. </AbstractText> "

Clonal expansion of T cells correlating with disease activity has been observed in peripheral blood (PB) of SLE subjects. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the T cell receptor (TCR) β loci has emerged as a sensitive way to measure the T cell repertoire. In this study, we utilized NGS to assess whether changes in T cell repertoire diversity in PB of SLE patients correlate with or predict changes in disease activity.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Total RNA was isolated from the PB of 11 SLE patients. Each subject had three samples, collected at periods of clinical quiescence and at a flare. Twelve age-matched healthy controls (HC) were used for reference. NGS was used to profile the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the rearranged TCR β loci.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Relative to the HC, SLE patients (at quiescence) demonstrated a 2.2-fold reduction in repertoire diversity in a given PB volume (P &lt;0.0002), a more uneven distribution of the repertoire (Gini coefficient, HC vs SLE, P = 0.015), and a trend toward increased percentage of expanded clones in the repertoire (clone size &gt;1.0%, HC vs SLE, P = 0.078). No significant correlation between the overall repertoire diversity and clinical disease activity was observed for most SLE patients with only two of eleven SLE patients showing a decreasing trend in repertoire diversity approaching the flare time point. We did not observe any overlap of CDR3 amino acid sequences or a preferential Vβ or Jβ gene usage among the top 100 expanded clones from all SLE patients.

SD loci often show copy numbers variations (CNV), which are difficult to tag with genotyping methods. CNV in the Fcγ receptor region (FCGR) has been suggested to be associated with rheumatic diseases. The objective of this study was to delineate association of FCGR-CNV with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), coeliac disease and Inflammatory bowel disease incidence. We developed a method to accurately quantify CNV in SD loci based on the intensity values from the Immunochip platform and applied it to the FCGR locus. We determined the method's validity using three independent assays: segregation analysis in families, arrayCGH, and whole genome sequencing. Our data showed the presence of two separate CNVs in the FCGR locus. The first region encodes FCGR2A, FCGR3A and part of FCGR2C gene, the second encodes another part of FCGR2C, FCGR3B and FCGR2B. Analysis of CNV status in 4578 individuals with RA and 5457 controls indicated association of duplications in the FCGR3B gene in antibody-negative RA (P=0.002, OR=1.43). Deletion in FCGR3B was associated with increased risk of antibody-positive RA, consistently with previous reports (P=0.023, OR=1.23). A clear genotype-phenotype relationship was observed: CNV polymorphisms of the FCGR3A gene correlated to CD16A expression (encoded by FCGR3A) on CD8 T-cells. In conclusion, our method allows determining the CNV status of the FCGR locus, we identified association of CNV in FCGR3B to RA and showed a functional relationship between CNV in the FCGR3A gene and CD16A expression. </AbstractText> "

To investigate the molecular mechanism of allopurinol-induced SCAR, we enrolled 21 patients (13 Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 8 drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)), 11 tolerant controls, and 23 healthy donors. We performed in vitro T-cell activation assays by culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with allopurinol, oxypurinol, or febuxostat and measuring the expression of granulysin and IFN-γ in the supernatants of cultures. TCR repertoire was investigated by next-generation sequencing. Oxypurinol stimulation resulted in a significant increase in granulysin in the cultures of blood samples from SCAR patients (n=14) but not tolerant controls (n=11) or healthy donors (n=23). Oxypurinol induced T-cell response in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, whereas allopurinol or febuxostat did not. T cells from patients with allopurinol-SCAR showed no crossreactivity with febuxostat. Preferential TCR-V-β usage and clonal expansion of specific CDR3 (third complementarity-determining region) were found in the blister cells from skin lesions (n=8) and oxypurinol-activated T-cell cultures (n=4) from patients with allopurinol-SCAR.

Despite systemic immunosuppressive treatment, disease activity persisted in the patient and was associated with elevated serum levels of IFNα and up-regulation of IFIH1 itself.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This finding adds a new genetic causation for Mendelian lupus and greatly extends the disease spectrum associated with mutations in IFIH1 (ranging from inflammatory encephalopathy to prototypic systemic autoimmune disease). This marked phenotypic heterogeneity, despite an identical mutation, demonstrates the importance of modifying factors in type I IFN-dependent pathologies caused by mutations in IFIH1.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2015, American College of Rheumatology.</CopyrightInformation> "
"367";"25700344";"Immunoglobulin kappa variable region gene selection during early human B cell development in health and systemic lupus erythematosus.";" <AbstractText>The unique specificity of the B cell receptor is generated by an ordered sequence of gene rearrangement events. Once IGH genes have rearranged, rearrangement at the IGK locus is initiated followed by the IGL locus if functional IGK rearrangement is not achieved. Receptor specificity can subsequently be altered by secondary light chain editing based on the features of the heavy and light chain combination. The final profile of expressed genes is not random and biases in this profile are associated with several autoimmune diseases. However, how and when biases are created is not known. To increase our understanding of the processes of selection and editing of IGK rearrangements, we compared four groups of rearrangements of IGK acquired by next generation sequencing. First, expressed rearrangements of IGK from cDNA of IGK expressing B cells. Second, productive rearrangements of IGK from DNA of the same kappa expressing B cells. Third, non-productive rearrangements of IGK from DNA of IGK and IGL expressing B cells, and fourth productively rearranged IGK from DNA of IGL expressing B cells. The latter group would have been rejected during B cell development in favour of rearrangement at the IGL locus and are therefore selected against. We saw evidence that rearranged IGK segments can be selected at a checkpoint where the decision to rearrange the IGL locus is made. In addition, our data suggest that mechanisms regulating the expression or not of IGK rearrangements may also contribute to repertoire development and also that this latter component of the selection process is defective in SLE. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We studied the number of COX-deficient fibers and the amount of mtDNA deletions, and if variants in nuclear genes involved in mtDNA maintenance may contribute to the occurrence of mtDNA deletions in IBM muscle. Twenty-six IBM patients were included. COX-deficient fibers were assayed by morphometry and mtDNA deletions by qPCR. POLG was analyzed in all patients by Sanger sequencing and C10orf2 (Twinkle), DNA2, MGME1, OPA1, POLG2, RRM2B, SLC25A4 and TYMP in six patients by next generation sequencing. Patients with many COX-deficient muscle fibers had a significantly higher proportion of mtDNA deletions than patients with few COX-deficient fibers. We found previously unreported variants in POLG and C10orf2 and IBM patients had a significantly higher frequency of an RRM2B variant than controls. POLG variants appeared more common in IBM patients with many COX-deficient fibers, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that COX-deficient fibers in inclusion body myositis are associated with multiple mtDNA deletions. In IBM patients we found novel and also previously reported variants in genes of importance for mtDNA maintenance that warrants further studies. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) interactions that influence H4 acetylation (H4ac) in SLE. Intracellular flow cytometry for H4 acetylated lysine (K) 5, K8, K12, and K16 was performed. Histone acetylation was defined in monocytes and T cells from controls and SLE patients. RNA-Seq studies were performed on monocytes to look for an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzyme expression. Expression levels were validated using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. IRF1 induction of H4ac was evaluated using D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. IRF1 protein interactions were studied using co-immunoprecipitation assays. IRF1-dependent recruitment of histone acetyltransferases to target genes was examined by ChIP assays using p300 antibody. Flow cytometry data showed significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, and H4K16 acetylation in SLE monocytes. HDAC3 and HDAC11 gene expression were decreased in SLE monocytes. PCAF showed significantly higher gene expression in SLE than controls. IRF1-overexpressing D54MG cells were associated with significantly increased H4K5, H4K8, and H4K12 acetylation compared to vector-control D54MG cells both globally and at specific target genes. Co-immunoprecipitation studies using D54MG cells revealed IRF1 protein-protein interactions with PCAF, P300, CBP, GCN5, ATF2, and HDAC3. ChIP experiments demonstrated increased p300 recruitment to known IRF1 targets in D54MG cells overexpressing IRF1. In contrast, p300 binding to IRF1 targets decreased in D54MG cells with IRF1 knockdown. SLE appears to be associated with an imbalance in histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylase enzymes favoring pathologic H4 acetylation. Furthermore, IRF1 directly interacts with chromatin modifying enzymes, supporting a model where recruitment to specific target genes is mediated in part by IRF1.</AbstractText> "

"371";"25335895";"Composition and variation analysis of TCR β-chain CDR3 repertoire in the thymus and spleen of MRL/lpr mouse at different ages.";" <AbstractText>T cells play an important role in the onset and progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the biases in T cell receptor beta variable (TRBV) region families and complementarity determining region three (CDR3) composition in SLE patients and mouse models have been widely reported. However, the relationship between the composition and variation in the TCR β-chain CDR3 repertoire and SLE has not been established. Here, we compared and analyzed the thymic and splenic TCR β-chain CDR3 mRNA sequences by Roche 454 high-throughput sequencing from MRL/lpr mice at different ages. Our results indicate that diversity in the TCR CDR3 repertoire from the thymus and spleen from MRL/lpr mouse was significantly decreased with increased age (disease progression) and showed a bias in usage of common TRBV and TRBJ families. The N1 region insertions in the highly expressed CDR3s significantly increased with disease progression. This study provides a new perspective for studying SLE with progression of disease in clonal level of TCR, which may provide a basis for studying the mechanism of the MRL/lpr autoreactive T cells response and tailor an individualized treatment targeting these T cells. </AbstractText> "

Previous linkage and association studies in European-American populations suggested genetic role of IRF2 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, this observation has not yet been confirmed. No studies have been reported in the Asian populations. Here we investigated whether IRF2 polymorphisms contribute to susceptibility to SLE in a Japanese population. Association study of 46 IRF2 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected association of an intronic SNP, rs13146124, with SLE. When the association was analyzed in 834 Japanese patients with SLE and 817 healthy controls, rs13146124 T was significantly increased in SLE compared with healthy controls (dominant model, P = 5.4×10(-4), Bonferroni-corrected P [Pc] = 0.026, odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.85). To find causal SNPs, resequencing was performed by next-generation sequencing. Twelve polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium with rs13146124 (r2: 0.30-1.00) were identified, among which significant association was observed for rs66801661 (allele model, P = 7.7×10(-4), Pc = 0.037, OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.19-1.96) and rs62339994 (dominant model, P = 9.0×10(-4), Pc = 0.043, OR 1.46, 95%CI 1.17-1.82). The haplotype carrying both of the risk alleles (rs66801661A-rs62339994A) was significantly increased in SLE (P = 9.9×10(-4)), while the haplotype constituted by both of the non-risk alleles (rs66801661G-rs62339994G) was decreased (P = 0.0020). A reporter assay was carried out to examine the effect of the IRF2 haplotypes on the transcriptional activity, and association of the IRF2 risk haplotype with higher transcriptional activity was detected in Jurkat T cells under IFNγ stimulation (Tukey's test, P = 1.2×10(-4)). In conclusion, our observations supported the association of IRF2 with susceptibility to SLE, and the risk haplotype was suggested to be associated with transcriptional activation of IRF2.</AbstractText> "

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) isa chronic and heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Both twin and sibling studies indicate a strong genetic contribution to lupus, but in the majority of cases the pathogenic variant remains to be identified. The genetic contribution to disease is likely to be greatest in cases with early onset and severe phenotypes. Whole-exome sequencing now offers the possibility of identifying rare alleles responsible for disease in such cases. This study was undertaken to identify genetic causes of SLE using whole-exome sequencing.Methods. We performed whole-exome sequencing in a 4-year-old girl with early-onset SLE and conducted biochemical analysis of the putative defect.Results. Whole-exome sequencing in a 4-year-old girl with cerebral lupus identified a rare, homozygous mutation in the three prime repair exonuclease 1 gene(TREX1) that was predicted to be highly deleterious.The TREX1 R97H mutant protein had a 20-fold reduction in exonuclease activity and was associated with an elevated interferon-alpha signature in the patient.The discovery and characterization of a pathogenic TREX1 variant in our proband has therapeutic implications.The patient is now a candidate for therapy. Conclusion. Our study is the first to demonstrate that whole-exome sequencing can be used to identify rare or novel deleterious variants as genetic causes of SLE and, through a personalized approach, improve therapeutic options.</AbstractText> "

"376";"25091625";"DNA methylation and mRNA and microRNA expression of SLE CD4+ T cells correlate with disease phenotype.";" <AbstractText>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease well known for its clinical heterogeneity, and its etiology secondary to a cross-talk involving genetic predisposition and environmental stimuli. Although genome-wide analysis has contributed greatly to our understanding of the genetic basis of SLE, there is increasing evidence for a role of epigenetics. Indeed, recent data have demonstrated that in patients with SLE, there are striking alterations of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and deregulated microRNA expression, the sum of which contribute to over-expression of select autoimmune-related genes and loss of tolerance. To address this issue at the level of clinical phenotype, we performed DNA methylation, mRNA and microRNA expression screening using high-throughput sequencing of purified CD4+ T cells from patients with SLE, compared to age and sex matched controls. In particular, we studied 42 patients with SLE and divided this group into three clinical phenotypes: a) the presence of skin lesions without signs of systemic pathology; b) skin lesions but also chronic renal pathology; and c) skin lesions, chronic renal pathology and polyarticular disease. Interestingly, and as expected, sequencing data revealed changes in DNA methylation in SLE compared to controls. However, and more importantly, although there were common methylation changes found in all groups of SLE compared to controls, there was specific DNA methylation changes that correlated with clinical phenotype. These included changes in the novel key target genes NLRP2, CD300LB and S1PR3, as well as changes in the critical pathways, including the adherens junction and leukocyte transendothelial migration. We also noted that a significant proportion of genes undergoing DNA methylation changes were inversely correlated with gene expression and that miRNA screening revealed the existence of subsets with changes in expression. Integrated analysis of this data highlights specific sets of miRNAs controlled by DNA methylation, and genes that are altered by methylation and targeted by miRNAs. In conclusion, our findings suggest select epigenetic mechanisms that contribute to clinical phenotypes and further shed light on a new venue for basic SLE research. </AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we show enrichment of Rhodotorula sequences in the skin of patients with early, diffuse SSc compared with that in normal controls. RNA-seq was performed on four SSc patients and four controls, to a depth of 200 million reads per patient. Data were analyzed to quantify the nonhuman sequence reads in each sample. We found little difference between bacterial microbiome and viral read counts, but found a significant difference between the read counts for a mycobiome component, R. glutinis. Normal samples contained almost no detected R. glutinis or other Rhodotorula sequence reads (mean score 0.021 for R. glutinis, 0.024 for all Rhodotorula). In contrast, SSc samples had a mean score of 5.039 for R. glutinis (5.232 for Rhodotorula). We were able to assemble the D1-D2 hypervariable region of the 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of R. glutinis from each of the SSc samples. Taken together, these results suggest that R. glutinis may be present in the skin of early SSc patients at higher levels than in normal skin, raising the possibility that it may be triggering the inflammatory response found in SSc. </AbstractText> "

Through identity-by-descent (IBD) mapping and whole-exome sequencing, we identified a non-synonymous c.2263G&gt;C (p.G755R) mutation at the PLB1 gene on 2q23, which significantly co-segregated with RA in family members with a dominant mode of inheritance (P = 0.009). We further evaluated PLB1 variants and risk of RA using a GWAS meta-analysis of 8,875 RA cases and 29,367 controls of European ancestry. We identified significant contributions of two independent non-coding variants near PLB1 with risk of RA (rs116018341 [MAF = 0.042] and rs116541814 [MAF = 0.021], combined P = 3.2 × 10(-6)). Finally, we performed deep exon sequencing of PLB1 in 1,088 RA cases and 1,088 controls (European ancestry), and identified suggestive dispersion of rare protein-coding variant frequencies between cases and controls (P = 0.049 for C-alpha test and P = 0.055 for SKAT). Together, these data suggest that PLB1 is a candidate risk gene for RA. Future studies to characterize the full spectrum of genetic risk in the PLB1 genetic locus are warranted.</AbstractText> "

Microarray studies provide insight into cartilage aging but do not reveal the full transcriptomic phenotype of chondrocytes such as small noncoding RNAs, pseudogenes, and microRNAs. RNA-Seq is a powerful technique for the interrogation of large numbers of transcripts including nonprotein coding RNAs. The aim of the study was to characterise molecular mechanisms associated with age-related changes in gene signatures.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">RNA for gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq and real-time PCR analysis was isolated from macroscopically normal cartilage of the metacarpophalangeal joints of eight horses; four young donors (4 years old) and four old donors (&gt;15 years old). RNA sequence libraries were prepared following ribosomal RNA depletion and sequencing was undertaken using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Differentially expressed genes were defined using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction with a generalised linear model likelihood ratio test (P &lt; 0.05, expression ratios ± 1.4 log₂ fold-change). Ingenuity pathway analysis enabled networks, functional analyses and canonical pathways from differentially expressed genes to be determined.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">In total, the expression of 396 transcribed elements including mRNAs, small noncoding RNAs, pseudogenes, and a single microRNA was significantly different in old compared with young cartilage (± 1.4 log2 fold-change, P &lt; 0.05). Of these, 93 were at higher levels in the older cartilage and 303 were at lower levels in the older cartilage. There was an over-representation of genes with reduced expression relating to extracellular matrix, degradative proteases, matrix synthetic enzymes, cytokines and growth factors in cartilage derived from older donors compared with young donors. In addition, there was a reduction in Wnt signalling in ageing cartilage.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">There was an age-related dysregulation of matrix, anabolic and catabolic cartilage factors. This study has increased our knowledge of transcriptional networks in cartilage ageing by providing a global view of the transcriptome.</AbstractText> "

"387";"23716478";"Developmental dysplasia of the hip: linkage mapping and whole exome sequencing identify a shared variant in CX3CR1 in all affected members of a large multigeneration family.";" <AbstractText>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a debilitating condition characterized by incomplete formation of the acetabulum leading to dislocation of the femur, suboptimal joint function, and accelerated wear of the articular cartilage resulting in arthritis. DDH affects 1 in 1000 newborns in the United States; there are well-defined &quot;pockets&quot; of high prevalence in Japan, and in Italy and other Mediterranean countries. Although reasonably accurate for detecting gross forms of hip dysplasia, existing techniques fail to find milder forms of dysplasia. Undetected hip dysplasia is the leading cause of osteoarthritis of the hip in young individuals, causing over 40% of cases in this age group. A sensitive and specific test for DDH has remained a desirable yet elusive goal in orthopedics for a long time. A 72-member, four-generation affected family has been recruited, and DNA from its members retrieved. Genomewide linkage analysis revealed a 2.61-Mb candidate region (38.7-41.31 Mb from the p term of chromosome 3) co-inherited by all affected members with a maximum logarithm (base 10) of odds (LOD) score of 3.31. Whole exome sequencing and analysis of this candidate region in four severely affected family members revealed one shared variant, rs3732378, that causes a threonine (polar) to methionine (non-polar) alteration at position 280 in the transmembrane domain of CX3CR1. This mutation is predicted to have a deleterious effect on its encoded protein, which functions as a receptor for the ligand fractalkine. By Sanger sequencing this variant was found to be present in the DNA of all affected individuals and obligate heterozygotes. CX3CR1 mediates cellular adhesive and migratory functions and is known to be expressed in mesenchymal stem cells destined to become chondrocytes. A genetic risk factor that might be among the etiologic factors for the family in this study has been identified, along with other possible aggravating mutations shared by four severely affected family members. These findings might illuminate the molecular pathways affecting chondrocyte maturation and bone formation.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>© 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.</CopyrightInformation> "

In two patients, the repertoires in different joints were compared. Repertoires were analysed by next-generation sequencing from mRNA, generating &gt;10 000 BCR heavy-chain sequence reads per sample. For each clone, the degree of expansion was calculated as the percentage of the total number of reads encoding the specific clonal sequence. Clones with a frequency ≥ 0.5% were considered dominant.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Multiple dominant clones were found in inflamed synovium but hardly any in blood. Within an individual patient, the same dominant clones were detected in different joints. The majority of the synovial clones were class-switched; however, the fraction of clones that expressed IgM was higher in ESRA than ERA patients. Dominant synovial clones showed autoreactive features: in ERA in particular the clones were enriched for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene segment V4-34 (IGHV4-34) and showed longer CDR3 lengths. Dominant synovial clones that did not encode IGHV4-34 also had longer CDR3s than peripheral blood.</AbstractText> <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In RA, the synovium forms a niche where expanded--potentially autoreactive--B cells and plasma cells reside.

IRF5 expression is significantly upregulated in SLE patients and upregulation associates with IRF5-SLE risk haplotypes. IRF5 alternative splicing has also been shown to be elevated in SLE patients. Given that human IRF5 exists as multiple alternatively spliced transcripts with distinct function(s), it is important to determine whether the IRF5 transcript profile expressed in healthy donor immune cells is different from that expressed in SLE patients. Moreover, it is not currently known whether an IRF5-SLE risk haplotype defines the profile of IRF5 transcripts expressed. Using standard molecular cloning techniques, we identified and isolated 14 new differentially spliced IRF5 transcript variants from purified monocytes of healthy donors and SLE patients to generate an IRF5 variant transcriptome. Next-generation sequencing was then used to perform in-depth and quantitative analysis of full-length IRF5 transcript expression in primary immune cells of SLE patients and healthy donors by next-generation sequencing. Evidence for additional alternatively spliced transcripts was obtained from de novo junction discovery. Data from these studies support the overall complexity of IRF5 alternative splicing in SLE. Results from next-generation sequencing correlated with cloning and gave similar abundance rankings in SLE patients thus supporting the use of this new technology for in-depth single gene transcript profiling. Results from this study provide the first proof that 1) SLE patients express an IRF5 transcript signature that is distinct from healthy donors, 2) an IRF5-SLE risk haplotype defines the top four most abundant IRF5 transcripts expressed in SLE patients, and 3) an IRF5 transcript signature enables clustering of SLE patients with the H2 risk haplotype.</AbstractText> "

"395";"22563483";"Concordant signaling pathways produced by pesticide exposure in mice correspond to pathways identified in human Parkinson's disease.";" <AbstractText>Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the etiology of 90 percent of the patients is unknown. Pesticide exposure is a major risk factor for PD, and paraquat (PQ), pyridaben (PY) and maneb (MN) are amongst the most widely used pesticides. We studied mRNA expression using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) in the ventral midbrain (VMB) and striatum (STR) of PQ, PY and paraquat+maneb (MNPQ) treated mice, followed by pathway analysis. We found concordance of signaling pathways between the three pesticide models in both the VMB and STR as well as concordance in these two brain areas. The concordant signaling pathways with relevance to PD pathogenesis were e.g. axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, as well as pathways not previously linked to PD, e.g. basal cell carcinoma, human embryonic stem cell pluripotency and role of macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in rheumatoid arthritis. Human PD pathways previously identified by expression analysis, concordant with VMB pathways identified in our study were axonal guidance signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, IL-6 signaling, ephrin receptor signaling, TGF-β signaling, PPAR signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Human PD pathways concordant with the STR pathways in our study were Wnt/β-catenin signaling, axonal guidance signaling and G-protein coupled receptor signaling. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (Ppard) and G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) were common genes in VMB and STR identified by network analysis. In conclusion, the pesticides PQ, PY and MNPQ elicit common signaling pathways in the VMB and STR in mice, which are concordant with known signaling pathways identified in human PD, suggesting that these pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic PD. The analysis of these networks and pathways may therefore lead to improved understanding of disease pathogenesis, and potential novel therapeutic targets.</AbstractText> "

"398";"22046267";"A new methodology to associate SNPs with human diseases according to their pathway related context.";" <AbstractText>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with hundreds of żthousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are popular strategies to reveal the genetic basis of human complex diseases. Despite many successes of GWAS, it is well recognized that new analytical approaches have to be integrated to achieve their full potential. Starting with a list of SNPs, found to be associated with disease in GWAS, here we propose a novel methodology to devise functionally important KEGG pathways through the identification of genes within these pathways, where these genes are obtained from SNP analysis. Our methodology is based on functionalization of important SNPs to identify effected genes and disease related pathways. We have tested our methodology on WTCCC Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) dataset and identified: i) previously known RA related KEGG pathways (e.g., Toll-like receptor signaling, Jak-STAT signaling, Antigen processing, Leukocyte transendothelial migration and MAPK signaling pathways); ii) additional KEGG pathways (e.g., Pathways in cancer, Neurotrophin signaling, Chemokine signaling pathways) as associated with RA. Furthermore, these newly found pathways included genes which are targets of RA-specific drugs. Even though GWAS analysis identifies 14 out of 83 of those drug target genes; newly found functionally important KEGG pathways led to the discovery of 25 out of 83 genes, known to be used as drug targets for the treatment of RA. Among the previously known pathways, we identified additional genes associated with RA (e.g. Antigen processing and presentation, Tight junction). Importantly, within these pathways, the associations between some of these additionally found genes, such as HLA-C, HLA-G, PRKCQ, PRKCZ, TAP1, TAP2 and RA were verified by either OMIM database or by literature retrieved from the NCBI PubMed module. With the whole-genome sequencing on the horizon, we show that the full potential of GWAS can be achieved by integrating pathway and network-oriented analysis and prior knowledge from functional properties of a SNP.</AbstractText> "

Genotypes were imputed into 41,675 chip-genotyped Icelanders and their relatives, for effective sample sizes of 968 individuals with gout and 15,506 individuals for whom serum uric acid measurements were available. We identified a low-frequency missense variant (c.1580C&gt;G) in ALDH16A1 associated with gout (OR = 3.12, P = 1.5 × 10(-16), at-risk allele frequency = 0.019) and serum uric acid levels (effect = 0.36 s.d., P = 4.5 × 10(-21)). We confirmed the association with gout by performing Sanger sequencing on 6,017 Icelanders. The association with gout was stronger in males relative to females. We also found a second variant on chromosome 1 associated with gout (OR = 1.92, P = 0.046, at-risk allele frequency = 0.986) and serum uric acid levels (effect = 0.48 s.d., P = 4.5 × 10(-16)).

High levels of BOC mRNA and protein expression have been described in embryonic tissues with active cell proliferation and ongoing cellular differentiation(1,2). A microarray-based screen of RNA isolated from 11 different adult equine tissues unexpectedly identified BOC as having an expression pattern restricted to articular cartilage. The objective of this study was to further investigate BOC expression in adult articular cartilage relative to other tissues. Both RT-qPCR and mRNA sequencing confirmed the microarray data. Steady state BOC mRNA levels in articular cartilage were substantially higher than in the other adult tissues tested, neonatal tendon, placenta, and whole embryo. The expression of BOC displayed a pattern of tissue specificity comparable to well established cartilage matrix protein biomarkers. BOC mRNA levels in articular cartilage increased with age, but were rapidly down-regulated when chondrocytes were enzymatically isolated from the cartilage matrix and expanded in monolayer culture. Relative expression patterns of CDO were broadly similar, but displayed lower fold change differences. A functional role in articular cartilage that involves Hedgehog signaling is suggested by the known binding affinity of BOC for all three Hedgehog ligands. These data also extend BOC and CDO biology to a post-mitotic and highly differentiated cell type within a mature tissue.</AbstractText> <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2011 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.

Methods: The expression of microRNAs derived from plasma exosome of patients with PsA (n=30), PV (n=15), RA (n=15), GA (n=15), and healthy controls (n=15) was evaluated via sequencing. Function analysis of common expressed microRNAs was conducted by the Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Coexpression analysis was conducted to identify novel and significant genes and proteins by using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). A systematic literature review was conducted to uncover the role of the common microRNAs in the pathogenesis of PsA, PV, RA, and GA. Results: A total of 36 common expressed microRNAs were detected in patients with PsA, PV, RA, and GA. The most significantly enriched biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions were homophilic cell adhesion via plasma membrane adhesion molecules, CCR4-NOT complex, and calcium ion binding, respectively. Antigen processing and presentation was the most significantly enriched pathway. A total of 91 validated coexpressed gene pairs were identified and 16 common expressed microRNAs and 85 potential target genes were screened based on Cytoscape. Of 36 common expressed microRNAs, 5 microRNAs, including hsa-miR-151a-3p, hsa-miR-199a-5p, hsa-miR-370-3p, hsa-miR-589-5p, and hsa-miR-769-5p, were considered to be connected with the common pathogenesis of PsA, PV, RA, and GA. Systemic review revealed that the roles of these 5 microRNAs are related to immune disorder and bone injury, which matches the conclusion from GO and KEGG analyses. Conclusion: (1) Both immune disorder and bone metabolic dysregulation could be the shared mechanism in the development of PsA, PV, RA, and GA. (2) Immune dysfunction is involved in GA. Our study may shed new light on the diagnosis and treatment strategy of these autoimmune diseases and GA, which warrants further studies."

Completely understanding this process requires that targeted antigens be identified, and so a number of techniques have been developed to determine immune receptor specificities. We previously reported the construction of a phage-displayed synthetic human peptidome and a proof-of-principle analysis of antibodies from three patients with neurological autoimmunity. Here we present data from a large-scale screen of 298 independent antibody repertoires, including those from 73 healthy sera, using phage immunoprecipitation sequencing. The resulting database of peptide-antibody interactions characterizes each individual's unique autoantibody fingerprint, and includes specificities found to occur frequently in the general population as well as those associated with disease. Screening type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients revealed a prematurely polyautoreactive phenotype compared with their matched controls. A collection of cerebrospinal fluids and sera from 63 multiple sclerosis patients uncovered novel, as well as previously reported antibody-peptide interactions. Finally, a screen of synovial fluids and sera from 64 rheumatoid arthritis patients revealed novel disease-associated antibody specificities that were independent of seropositivity status. This work demonstrates the utility of performing PhIP-Seq screens on large numbers of individuals and is another step toward defining the full complement of autoimmunoreactivities in health and disease."
