Systematic Literature Review
The literature review was implemented in R (version 3.6.1, [15]) using the package easyPubMed (version 2.13, [16]) and consists of 2 steps. First an automated pubmed search was carried on August 15th, 2020 out using the query string: 

"(methylomics OR epigenomics OR NGS OR \"next generation sequencing\" OR RNA-Seq OR \"mRNA sequencing\" OR \"RNA sequencing\" OR \"RNA-sequencing\" OR \"transcriptome sequencing\" OR \"whole exome sequencing\" OR \"whole-exome sequencing\" OR \"high throughput sequencing\" OR \"high-throughput sequencing\" OR \"DNA sequencing\" OR \"RNA sequencing\" OR \"RNA-sequencing\" OR \"DNA-sequencing\" OR WXS OR WGS OR \"whole-genome sequencing\" OR \"whole genome sequencing\") AND (rheumatology OR \"rheumatologic disease\" OR \"rheumatologic disease\" ))".

This search resulted in 1097 entries. The keywords of each returning dataset were intersected with official disease names extracted from ICD-11 [17] in order to filter out keywords that are not disease names. The remaining 253 keywords were then manually inspected to find rheumatic diseases. This approach identified the following diseases: autoinflammatory syndrome (AutoSyn), dermatomyositis, enthesitis, familial mediterranean fever (FMF), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), myositis, osteoarthritis (OA), polymyositis , psoriatic arthritis (PsA),  rheumatoid arthritis (RA), sacroiliitis, sjögren's syndrome, spondyloarthritis (SpA), synovitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis , vasculitis, uveitis, gout and polychondritis.
 
In a second step more specific pubmed search was carried out using the disease names identified in the first step: 

"(methylomics OR epigenomics OR NGS OR \"next generation sequencing\" OR RNA-Seq OR \"mRNA sequencing\" OR \"RNA sequencing\" OR \"RNA-sequencing\" OR \"transcriptome sequencing\" OR \"whole exome sequencing\" OR \"whole-exome sequencing\" OR \"high throughput sequencing\" OR \"high-throughput sequencing\" OR WXS OR WGS OR \"whole-genome sequencing\" OR \"whole genome sequencing\") AND (\"autoinflammatory syndrome\" OR dermatomyositis OR enthesitis OR \"familial mediterranean fever\" OR \"granulomatosis with polyangiitis\" OR \"juvenile idiopathic arthritis\" OR myositis OR osteoarthritis OR polymyositis OR \"psoriatic arthritis\" OR \"rheumatoid arthritis\" OR sacroiliitis OR \"sjögren syndrome\" OR \"sjögren's syndrome\" OR spondyloarthritis OR synovitis OR \"systemic lupus erythematosus\" OR \"systemic sclerosis\" OR vasculitis OR uveitis OR gout OR polychondritis)".
 
This search was carried on September 4th, 2020 and resulted in 1162 pubmed hits, which were (if possible) annotated regarding disease name, pubmed ID, assay, journal, year of publication by automatic screening the title and abstract. Reviews (i.e. publications which have “Review” in metadata) and commentaries were excluded and missing information was added manually by manual inspection of the publication. After manual curation, 699 studies were included in this literature review (Figure 1).

SRA data analysis
Searching the SRA portal was carried out via the SRA portal at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra using the diseases names identified in the literature review as key words one after another (i.e. only one disease was searched at a time), then using the Run Selector (“Send results to Run Selector”), switching to the old Run Selector (“Revert to the old Run Selector”) and downloading the metatable, which was input to a custom-built python script extracting all necessary information. In addition, the python package pysradb [18] was used for retrieving pubmed identifiers for an associated SRA project number.
