Here, we present the first evidence that interferon lambda is pathogenic and has nonredundant functions in TLR7-associated lupus inflammation. Most notably, we found that interferon lambda promotes systemic immune dysregulation through localized effects in the skin and kidneys. These data identify a novel role for interferon lambda in lupus immunobiology and tissue-specific pathology. Overall design: This dataset includes 6 scRNA samples. Immune cells were isolated from mouse spleen and human peripheral blood. Cells were treated with recombinant interferon alpha or interferon lambda for 4 hours. Single cell RNA seq analysis was subsequently performed to analyze responsiveness to stimulation with interferon alpha and interferon lambda cytokine across different immune cell clusters.

Here, we present the first evidence that interferon lambda is pathogenic and has nonredundant functions in TLR7-associated lupus inflammation. Most notably, we found that interferon lambda promotes systemic immune dysregulation through localized effects in the skin and kidneys. These data identify a novel role for interferon lambda in lupus immunobiology and tissue-specific pathology. Overall design: This dataset includes 6 scRNA samples. Immune cells were isolated from mouse spleen and human peripheral blood. Cells were treated with recombinant interferon alpha or interferon lambda for 4 hours. Single cell RNA seq analysis was subsequently performed to analyze responsiveness to stimulation with interferon alpha and interferon lambda cytokine across different immune cell clusters.
